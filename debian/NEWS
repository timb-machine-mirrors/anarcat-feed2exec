  * ikiwiki_recentchanges incompatible change

    The recent changes page can include multiple posts with the same GUID,
    as the GUID is simply the URL of the page. In blog posts, that's
    usually fine because we don't want to act every time a blog post
    is *modified* but for things like link checks or archival, it's
    actually important to fetch pages on each update.
    
    This will require the user to run `--catchup` on the feeds with that
    plugin enabled after upgrade.
    
    We simply prefix the GUID with a ISO-8601 formatted timestamp so that
    changes (above seconds increments) are considered
