def output(feed, item, lock=None, session=None):
    """load and run the given plugin with the given arguments

    an "output plugin" is a simple Python module with an ``output``
    callable defined which will process arguments and should output
    them somewhere, for example by email or through another
    command. the plugin is called (from :func:`feed2exec.feeds.parse`)
    when a new item is found, unless cache is flushed or ignored.

    The "callable" can be a class, in which case only the constructor
    is called or a function. The ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` parameter
    SHOULD be used in the function definition for
    forward-compatibility (ie. to make sure new parameters added do
    not cause a regression).

    Plugins should also expect to be called in parallel and should use
    the provided ``lock`` (a multiprocessor.Lock object) to acquire
    and release locks around contentious resources.

    Finally, the FeedManager will pass along his own ``session`` that
    should be reused by plugins to do requests. This allows plugins to
    be unit-tested and leverages the built-in cache as well.

    The following keywords are usually replaced in the arguments:

    * {item.link}
    * {item.title}
    * {item.description}
    * {item.published}
    * {item.updated}
    * {item.guid}

    The full list of such parameters is determined by the
    :module:feedparser module.

    Similarly, feed parameters from the configuration file are
    accessible.

    .. caution:: None of those parameters are sanitized in any way
                 other than what feedparser does, so plugins writing
                 files, executing code or talking to the network
                 should be careful to sanitize the input
                 appropriately.

    The feed and items are also passed to the plugin as keyword
    arguments. Plugins should especially respect the ``catchup``
    argument that, when set, forbids plugins to do any permanent
    activity. For example, plugins MUST NOT run commands, write files,
    or make network requests. In general, "catchup mode" should be
    *fast*: it allows users to quickly catchup with new feeds without
    firing plugins, but it should *also* allow users to test
    configurations so plugins SHOULD give information to the user
    about what would have been done by the plugin without ``catchup``.

    :param dict feed: the feed metadata
    :param dict item: the updated item
    :return object: the loaded plugin

    .. note:: more information about plugin design is in the
              :ref:`writing-plugins` document.
