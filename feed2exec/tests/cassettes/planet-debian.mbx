I just finished the presentation at the [Neo4j Online Meetup][1] on getting
the Debian [UDD][2] into a [Neo4j][3] graph database. Besides the usual
technical quibbles it did work out quite well.

   [1]: <https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/>
   [2]: <https://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase>
   [3]: <https://neo4j.com/>

The code for pulling the data from the UDD, as well as converting and
importing it into Neo4j is available on [Github Debian-Graph][4]. The slides
are also available on Github: [preining-debian-packages-neo4j.pdf][5].

There are still some things I want to implement, time permitting, because it
would be a great tool for better integration for Debian. In any case, graph
databases are lots of fun to play around.

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/joeyh2.png" width="84" height="75" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>This post has it all. Flotillas of sailboats, peer-to-peer wikis, games,
and de-frogging. But, I need to start by talking about some tech you may not
have heard of yet...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/">Scuttlebutt</a> is way for friends to share feeds
of content-addressed messages, peer-to-peer. Most Scuttlebutt clients
currently look something like facebook, but there are also github clones,
chess games, etc. Many private encrypted conversations going on.
All entirely decentralized.<br />
(My scuttlebutt feed can be viewed <a href="https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/@BCM6DHYJvWzwWi1lFl2tjDXjaqyZAEmJH5ZONSpXhtc=.ed25519">here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/annah">Annah</a> is a purely
functional, strongly typed language. Its design allows individual atoms
of the language to be put in content-addressed storage, right down to
data types. So the value <code>True</code> and a hash of the definition of what
<code>True</code> is can both be treated the same by Annah's compiler.<br />
(Not to be confused with my sister, Anna, or part of the Debian Installer
with the same name that I wrote long ago.)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So, how could these be combined together, and what might the result look
like?</p>

<p>Well, I could start by posting a Scuttlebutt message that <a href="http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Bool/True">defines what
True is</a>. And another
Scuttlebutt message defining
<a href="http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Bool/False">False</a>. And then,
another Scuttlebutt message to
<a href="http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Bool/and">define the AND function</a>,
which would link to my messages for <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>. Continue this until
I've built up enough Annah code to write some almost useful programs.</p>

<p>Annah can't do any IO on its own (though it can model IO similarly to how
Haskell does), so for programs to be actually useful, there needs to be
Scuttlebutt client support. The way typing works in Annah, a program's type
can be expressed as a Scuttlebutt link. So a Scuttlebutt client that wants
to run Annah programs of a particular type can pick out programs that link
to that type, and will know what type of data the program consumes and
produces.</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas of what could be built, with fairly simple client-side
support for different types of Annah programs...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shared dashboards.</strong>
<a href="https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25WPDqs%2FYnkPgjpGJrx36%2FoXgPHnmy6Ket29K4jMyVHyQ%3D.sha256">Boats in a flotilla are communicating via Scuttlebutt</a>,
and want to share a map of their planned courses. Coders collaborating
via Scuttlebutt want to see an overview of the state of their project.</p>

<p>For this, the Scuttlebutt client needs a way to run a selected Annah
program of type <code>Dashboard</code>, and display its output like a Scuttlebutt
message, in a dashboard window. The dashboard message gets updated
whenever other Scuttlebutt messages come in. The Annah program picks out
the messages it's interested in, and generates the dashboard message.</p>

<p>So, send a message updating your boat's position, and everyone sees it
update on the map. Send a message with updated weather forecasts as
they're received, and everyone can see the storm developing.
Send another message updating a waypoint to avoid the storm,
and steady as you go...</p>

<p>The coders, meanwhile, probably tweak their dashboard's code every day.
As they add git-ssb repos, they make the dashboard display an
overview of their bugs. They get CI systems hooked in and feeding
messages to Scuttlebutt, and make the dashboard go green or red. They
make the dashboard A-B test itself to pick the right shade of red.
And so on...</p>

<p>The dashboard program is stored in Scuttlebutt so everyone is on the same
page, and the most recent version of it posted by a team member gets
used. (Just have the old version of the program notice when there's a
newer version, and run that one..)</p>

<p>(Also could be used in disaster response scenarios, where the data
and visualization tools get built up on the fly in response to local needs,
and are shared peer-to-peer in areas without internet.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smart hyperlinks.</strong> When a hyperlink in a Scuttlebutt message points to a
Annah program, optionally with some Annah data, clicking on it can
run the program and display the messages that the program generates.</p>

<p>This is the most basic way a Scuttlebutt client could support Annah
programs, and it could be used for tons of stuff. A few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hiding spoilers.</strong>
Click on the link and it'll display a spoiler about a book/movie.</li>
<li><strong>A link to whatever I was talking about one year ago today.</strong>
That opens different messages as time goes by. Put it in your Scuttlebutt
profile or something. (Requires a way for Annah to get the current
date, which it normally has no way of accessing.)</li>
<li><strong>Choose your own adventure or twine style games.</strong>
Click on the link and the program starts the game, displaying
links to choose between, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Links to custom views.</strong>
For example, a link could lead to a combination of messages from
several different, related channels. Or could filter messages in some
way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Collaborative filtering.</strong> Suppose I don't want to see
frog-related memes in my Scuttlebutt client. I can write a
Annah program that calculates a message's frogginess, and outputs a
<code>Filtered Message</code>. It can leave a message unchanged, or filter it out,
or perhaps minimize its display. I publish the Annah program on my feed,
and tell my Scuttlebutt client to filter all messages through it before
displaying them to me.</p>

<p>I published the program in my Scuttlebutt feed, and so my friends
can use it too. They can build other filtering functions for other
stuff (such an an excess of orange in photos), and integrate my
frog filter into their filter program by simply composing the two.</p>

<p>If I like their filter, I can switch my client to using it. Or not.
Filtering is thus subjective, like Scuttlebutt, and the subjectivity is
expressed by picking the filter you want to use, or developing a
better one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wiki pages.</strong> Scuttlebutt is built on immutable append-only logs; it
doesn't have editable wiki pages. But they can be built on top using
Annah.</p>

<p>A smart link to a wiki page is a reference to the Annah program
that renders it. Of course being a wiki, there will be more smart
links on the wiki page going to other wiki pages, and so on.</p>

<p>The wiki page includes a smart link to edit it. The editor needs basic
form support in the Scuttlebutt client; when the edited wiki page is
posted, the Annah program diffs it against the previous version and
generates an <code>Edit</code> which gets posted to the user's feed. Rendering the
page is just a matter of finding the <code>Edit</code> messages for it from
people who are allowed to edit it, and combining them.</p>

<p>Anyone can fork a wiki page by posting an <code>Edit</code> to their feed. And can
then post a smart link to their fork of the page.</p>

<p>And anyone can merge other forks into their wiki page (this posts a
control message that makes the Annah program implementing the wiki accept
those forks' <code>Edit</code> messages). Or grant other users permission to edit
the wiki page (another control message). Or grant other users
permissions to grant other users permissions.</p>

<p>There are lots of different ways you might want your wiki to work.
No one wiki implementation, but lots of Annah programs. Others
can interact with your wiki using the program you picked, or fork it and
even switch the program used. Subjectivity again.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User-defined board games.</strong> The Scuttlebutt client finds
Scuttlebutt messages containing Annah programs of type <code>Game</code>,
and generates a tab with a list of available games.</p>

<p>The players of a particular game all experience the same game interface,
because the code for it is part of their shared Scuttlebutt message pool,
and the code to use gets agreed on at the start of a game.</p>

<p>To play a game, the Scuttlebutt client runs the Annah program, which
generates a description of the current contents of the game board.</p>

<p>So, for chess, use Annah to define a <code>ChessMove</code> data type,
and the Annah program takes the feeds of the two players, looks
for messages containing a <code>ChessMove</code>, and builds up a description
of the chess board.</p>

<p>As well as the pieces on the game board, the game board description
includes Annah functions that get called when the user moves a
game piece. That generates a new <code>ChessMove</code> which gets recorded
in the user's Scuttlebutt feed.</p>

<p>This could support a wide variety of board games. If you don't mind the
possibility that your opponent might cheat by peeking at the random seed,
even games involving things like random card shuffles and dice rolls
could be built. Also there can be games like Core Wars where the gamers
themselves write Annah programs to run inside the game.</p>

<p>Variants of games can be developed by modifying and reusing game
programs. For example, timed chess is just the chess program
with an added check on move time, and time clock display.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decentralized chat bots.</strong> Chat bots are all the rage (or were a few
months ago, tech fads move fast), but in a decentralized system like
Scuttlebutt, a bot running on a server somewhere would be a ugly point
of centralization. Instead, write a Annah program for the bot.</p>

<p>To launch the bot, publish a message in your own personal Scuttlebutt
feed that contains the bot's program, and a nonce.</p>

<p>The user's Scuttlebutt client takes care of the rest. It looks for messages
with bot programs, and runs the bot's program. This generates or updates
a Scuttlebutt message feed for the bot.</p>

<p>The bot's program signs the messages in its feed using a private key
that's generated by combining the user's public key, and the bot's nonce.
So, the bot has one feed per user it talks to, with deterministic
content, which avoids a problem with forking a Scuttlebutt feed.</p>

<p>The bot-generated messages can be stored in the Scuttlebutt database like any
other messages and replicated around. The bot appears as if it were a
Scuttlebutt user. But you can have conversations with it while you're
offline.</p>

<p>(The careful reader may have noticed that deeply private messages sent to
the bot can be decrypted by anyone! This bot thing is probably a bad idea
really, but maybe the bot fad is over anyway. We can only hope. It's
important that there be at least one bad idea in this list..)</p></li>

<p>This kind of extensibility in a peer-to-peer system is exciting! With these
new systems, we can consider lessons from the world wide web and replicate
some of the good parts, while avoiding the bad. Javascript has been both
good and bad for the web. The extensibility is great, and yet it's a
neverending security and privacy nightmare, and it ties web pages ever more
tightly to programs hidden away on servers. I believe that Annah combined
with Scuttlebutt will comprehensively avoid those problems. Shall we build it?</p>

http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/extending_Scuttlebutt_with_Annah/

This post has it all. Flotillas of sailboats, peer-to-peer wikis, games, and
de-frogging. But, I need to start by talking about some tech you may not have
heard of yet...

  * [Scuttlebutt][1] is way for friends to share feeds of content-addressed messages, peer-to-peer. Most Scuttlebutt clients currently look something like facebook, but there are also github clones, chess games, etc. Many private encrypted conversations going on. All entirely decentralized.  
(My scuttlebutt feed can be viewed [here][2])

   [1]: <https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/>
   [2]: <https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/@BCM6DHYJvWzwWi1lFl2tjDXjaqyZAEmJH5ZONSpXhtc=.ed25519>

  * [Annah][3] is a purely functional, strongly typed language. Its design allows individual atoms of the language to be put in content-addressed storage, right down to data types. So the value `True` and a hash of the definition of what `True` is can both be treated the same by Annah's compiler.  
(Not to be confused with my sister, Anna, or part of the Debian Installer with
the same name that I wrote long ago.)

   [3]: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/annah>

So, how could these be combined together, and what might the result look like?

Well, I could start by posting a Scuttlebutt message that [defines what True
is][4]. And another Scuttlebutt message defining [False][5]. And then, another
Scuttlebutt message to [define the AND function][6], which would link to my
messages for `True` and `False`. Continue this until I've built up enough
Annah code to write some almost useful programs.

   [4]: <http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Bool/True>
   [5]: <http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Bool/False>
   [6]: <http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Bool/and>

Annah can't do any IO on its own (though it can model IO similarly to how
Haskell does), so for programs to be actually useful, there needs to be
Scuttlebutt client support. The way typing works in Annah, a program's type
can be expressed as a Scuttlebutt link. So a Scuttlebutt client that wants to
run Annah programs of a particular type can pick out programs that link to
that type, and will know what type of data the program consumes and produces.

Here are a few ideas of what could be built, with fairly simple client-side
support for different types of Annah programs...

  * **Shared dashboards.** [Boats in a flotilla are communicating via Scuttlebutt][7], and want to share a map of their planned courses. Coders collaborating via Scuttlebutt want to see an overview of the state of their project.

   [7]: <https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25WPDqs%2FYnkPgjpGJrx36%2FoXgPHnmy6Ket29K4jMyVHyQ%3D.sha256>

For this, the Scuttlebutt client needs a way to run a selected Annah program
of type `Dashboard`, and display its output like a Scuttlebutt message, in a
dashboard window. The dashboard message gets updated whenever other
Scuttlebutt messages come in. The Annah program picks out the messages it's
interested in, and generates the dashboard message.

So, send a message updating your boat's position, and everyone sees it update
on the map. Send a message with updated weather forecasts as they're received,
and everyone can see the storm developing. Send another message updating a
waypoint to avoid the storm, and steady as you go...

The coders, meanwhile, probably tweak their dashboard's code every day. As
they add git-ssb repos, they make the dashboard display an overview of their
bugs. They get CI systems hooked in and feeding messages to Scuttlebutt, and
make the dashboard go green or red. They make the dashboard A-B test itself to
pick the right shade of red. And so on...

The dashboard program is stored in Scuttlebutt so everyone is on the same
page, and the most recent version of it posted by a team member gets used.
(Just have the old version of the program notice when there's a newer version,
and run that one..)

(Also could be used in disaster response scenarios, where the data and
visualization tools get built up on the fly in response to local needs, and
are shared peer-to-peer in areas without internet.)

  * **Smart hyperlinks.** When a hyperlink in a Scuttlebutt message points to a Annah program, optionally with some Annah data, clicking on it can run the program and display the messages that the program generates.

This is the most basic way a Scuttlebutt client could support Annah programs,
and it could be used for tons of stuff. A few examples:

    * **Hiding spoilers.** Click on the link and it'll display a spoiler about a book/movie.
    * **A link to whatever I was talking about one year ago today.** That opens different messages as time goes by. Put it in your Scuttlebutt profile or something. (Requires a way for Annah to get the current date, which it normally has no way of accessing.)
    * **Choose your own adventure or twine style games.** Click on the link and the program starts the game, displaying links to choose between, and so on.
    * **Links to custom views.** For example, a link could lead to a combination of messages from several different, related channels. Or could filter messages in some way.
  * **Collaborative filtering.** Suppose I don't want to see frog-related memes in my Scuttlebutt client. I can write a Annah program that calculates a message's frogginess, and outputs a `Filtered Message`. It can leave a message unchanged, or filter it out, or perhaps minimize its display. I publish the Annah program on my feed, and tell my Scuttlebutt client to filter all messages through it before displaying them to me.

I published the program in my Scuttlebutt feed, and so my friends can use it
too. They can build other filtering functions for other stuff (such an an
excess of orange in photos), and integrate my frog filter into their filter
program by simply composing the two.

If I like their filter, I can switch my client to using it. Or not. Filtering
is thus subjective, like Scuttlebutt, and the subjectivity is expressed by
picking the filter you want to use, or developing a better one.

  * **Wiki pages.** Scuttlebutt is built on immutable append-only logs; it doesn't have editable wiki pages. But they can be built on top using Annah.

A smart link to a wiki page is a reference to the Annah program that renders
it. Of course being a wiki, there will be more smart links on the wiki page
going to other wiki pages, and so on.

The wiki page includes a smart link to edit it. The editor needs basic form
support in the Scuttlebutt client; when the edited wiki page is posted, the
Annah program diffs it against the previous version and generates an `Edit`
which gets posted to the user's feed. Rendering the page is just a matter of
finding the `Edit` messages for it from people who are allowed to edit it, and
combining them.

Anyone can fork a wiki page by posting an `Edit` to their feed. And can then
post a smart link to their fork of the page.

And anyone can merge other forks into their wiki page (this posts a control
message that makes the Annah program implementing the wiki accept those forks'
`Edit` messages). Or grant other users permission to edit the wiki page
(another control message). Or grant other users permissions to grant other
users permissions.

There are lots of different ways you might want your wiki to work. No one wiki
implementation, but lots of Annah programs. Others can interact with your wiki
using the program you picked, or fork it and even switch the program used.
Subjectivity again.

  * **User-defined board games.** The Scuttlebutt client finds Scuttlebutt messages containing Annah programs of type `Game`, and generates a tab with a list of available games.

The players of a particular game all experience the same game interface,
because the code for it is part of their shared Scuttlebutt message pool, and
the code to use gets agreed on at the start of a game.

To play a game, the Scuttlebutt client runs the Annah program, which generates
a description of the current contents of the game board.

So, for chess, use Annah to define a `ChessMove` data type, and the Annah
program takes the feeds of the two players, looks for messages containing a
`ChessMove`, and builds up a description of the chess board.

As well as the pieces on the game board, the game board description includes
Annah functions that get called when the user moves a game piece. That
generates a new `ChessMove` which gets recorded in the user's Scuttlebutt
feed.

This could support a wide variety of board games. If you don't mind the
possibility that your opponent might cheat by peeking at the random seed, even
games involving things like random card shuffles and dice rolls could be
built. Also there can be games like Core Wars where the gamers themselves
write Annah programs to run inside the game.

Variants of games can be developed by modifying and reusing game programs. For
example, timed chess is just the chess program with an added check on move
time, and time clock display.

  * **Decentralized chat bots.** Chat bots are all the rage (or were a few months ago, tech fads move fast), but in a decentralized system like Scuttlebutt, a bot running on a server somewhere would be a ugly point of centralization. Instead, write a Annah program for the bot.

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/sesse.png" width="74" height="85" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>Narabu is a new intraframe video codec, from the Japanese verb
<em>narabu</em> (並ぶ), which means to line up or be parallel.</p>

<p>Let me first state straight up that Narabu isn't where I hoped it would be at
this stage; the encoder isn't fast enough, and I have to turn my attention to
other projects for a while. Nevertheless, I think it is interesting as a
research project in its own right, and I don't think it should stop me from
trying to write up a small series. :-)</p>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/State-the-Problem-Before-Describing-the-Solution.pdf">Leslie
Lamport</a>,
I'll be starting off with describing what problem I was trying to solve,
which will hopefully make the design decisions a lot clearer. Subsequent
posts will dive into background information and then finally Narabu itself.</p>

<p>I want a codec to send signals between different instances of
<a href="https://nageru.sesse.net/">Nageru</a>, my free software video mixer,
and also longer-term between other software, such as recording or
playout. The reason is pretty
obvious for any sort of complex configuration; if you are doing e.g.
both a stream mix and a bigscreen mix, they will naturally want to use
many of the same sources, and sharing them over a single GigE connection
might be easier than getting SDI repeaters/splitters, especially when
you have a lot of them. (Also, in some cases, you might want to share
synthetic signals, such as graphics, that never existed on SDI in the
first place.)</p>

<p>This naturally leads to the following demands:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intraframe-only; every frame must be compressed independently. 
(This isn't strictly needed for all use cases, but is much more
flexible, and common in any kind of broadcast.)</li>
<li>Need to handle 4:2:2 color, since that's what most capture sources
give out, and we want to transmit the raw signals as much as possible.
Fairly flexible in input resolution (divisible by 16 is okay, limited
to only a given set of resolutions is not).</li>
<li>720p60 video in less than one CPU core (ideally much less); the CPU can
already pretty be busy with other work, like x264 encoding of the
finished stream, and sharing four more inputs at the same time
is pretty common. What matters is mostly a single encode+decode
cycle, so fast decode doesn't help if the encoder is too slow.</li>
<li>Target bitrates around 100-150 Mbit/sec, at similar quality to MJPEG
(ie. 45 dB PSNR for most content). Multiple signals should fit into a
normal GigE link at the same time, although getting it to work over 802.11
isn't a big priority.</li>
<li>Both encoder and decoder robust to corrupted or malicious data; a dropped
frame is fine, a crash is not.</li>
<li>Does not depend on uncommon or expensive hardware, or GPUs from a
specific manufacturer.</li>
<li>GPLv3-compatible implementation. I already link to GPLv3 software, so
I don't have a choice here; I cannot link to something non-free
(and no antics with dlopen(), please).</li>
</ul>

<p>There's a bunch of intraframe formats around. The most obvious thing to do
would be to use Intel Quick Sync to produce H.264 (intraframe H.264 blows
basically everything else out of the sky in terms of PSNR, and QSV hardly
uses any power at all), but sadly, that's limited to 4:2:0. I thought about
encoding the three color planes as three different monochrome streams, but
monochrome is not supported either.</p>

<p>Then there's a host of software solutions. x264 can do 4:2:2, but even on
ultrafast, it gobbles up an entire core or more at 720p60 at the target
bitrates (mostly in entropy coding). FFmpeg has implementations of all kinds
of other codecs, like DNxHD, CineForm, MJPEG and so on, but they all use much
more CPU for encoding than the target. NDI would seem to fit the bill
exactly, but fails the licensing check, and also isn't robust to corrupted or
malicious data. (That, and their claims about video quality are dramatically
overblown for any kinds of real video data I've tried.)</p>

<p>So, sadly, this leaves only really one choice, namely rolling my own.
I quickly figured I couldn't beat the world on CPU video codec speed,
and didn't really want to spend my life optimizing AVX2 DCTs anyway,
so again, the GPU will come to our rescue in the form of compute shaders.
(There are some other GPU codecs out there, but all that I've found depend
on CUDA, so they are NVIDIA-only, which I'm not prepared to commit to.)
Of course, the GPU is quite busy in Nageru, but if one can make an efficient
enough codec that one stream can work at only 5% or so of the GPU (meaning
1200 fps or so), it wouldn't really make a dent. (As a spoiler, the current
Narabu encoder isn't there for 720p60 on my GTX 950, but the decoder is.)</p>

<p>In the next post, we'll look a bit at the GPU programming model, and what
it means for how our codec needs to look like on the design level.</p>

  * GPLv3-compatible implementation. I already link to GPLv3 software, so I don't have a choice here; I cannot link to something non-free (and no antics with dlopen(), please).

There's a bunch of intraframe formats around. The most obvious thing to do
would be to use Intel Quick Sync to produce H.264 (intraframe H.264 blows
basically everything else out of the sky in terms of PSNR, and QSV hardly uses
any power at all), but sadly, that's limited to 4:2:0. I thought about
encoding the three color planes as three different monochrome streams, but
monochrome is not supported either.

Then there's a host of software solutions. x264 can do 4:2:2, but even on
ultrafast, it gobbles up an entire core or more at 720p60 at the target
bitrates (mostly in entropy coding). FFmpeg has implementations of all kinds
of other codecs, like DNxHD, CineForm, MJPEG and so on, but they all use much
more CPU for encoding than the target. NDI would seem to fit the bill exactly,
but fails the licensing check, and also isn't robust to corrupted or malicious
data. (That, and their claims about video quality are dramatically overblown
for any kinds of real video data I've tried.)

So, sadly, this leaves only really one choice, namely rolling my own. I
quickly figured I couldn't beat the world on CPU video codec speed, and didn't
really want to spend my life optimizing AVX2 DCTs anyway, so again, the GPU
will come to our rescue in the form of compute shaders. (There are some other
GPU codecs out there, but all that I've found depend on CUDA, so they are
NVIDIA-only, which I'm not prepared to commit to.) Of course, the GPU is quite
busy in Nageru, but if one can make an efficient enough codec that one stream
can work at only 5% or so of the GPU (meaning 1200 fps or so), it wouldn't
really make a dent. (As a spoiler, the current Narabu encoder isn't there for
720p60 on my GTX 950, but the decoder is.)

In the next post, we'll look a bit at the GPU programming model, and what it
means for how our codec needs to look like on the design level.

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/preining.png" width="65" height="85" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>It has been ages that I haven’t updated the MegaUpdate package for Kobo. Now that a new and seemingly rather bug-free and quick firmware release (4.6.9995) has been released, I finally took the time to update the whole package to the latest releases of all the included items. The update includes all my favorite patches and features: Kobo Start Menu, koreader, coolreader, pbchess, ssh access, custom dictionaries, and some side-loaded fonts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.preining.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/kobo_720w.png"><img alt="Kobo Logo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1241" height="380" src="http://www.preining.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/kobo_720w.png" width="720" /></a></p>
<p>So what are all these items:</p>

It has been ages that I haven’t updated the MegaUpdate package for Kobo. Now
that a new and seemingly rather bug-free and quick firmware release (4.6.9995)
has been released, I finally took the time to update the whole package to the
latest releases of all the included items. The update includes all my favorite
patches and features: Kobo Start Menu, koreader, coolreader, pbchess, ssh
access, custom dictionaries, and some side-loaded fonts.

[Kobo Logo][1]

   [1]: <http://www.preining.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/kobo_720w.png>

So what are all these items:

  * firmware ([thread][2]): the basic software of the device, shipped by Kobo company
  * Metazoa firmware patches ([thread][3]): fix some layout options and functionalities, see below for details.
  * Kobo Start Menu (V08, update 5b [thread][4]): a menu that pops up _before_ the reading software (nickel) starts, which allows to start alternative readers (like koreader) etc.
  * KOreader ([koreader-nightly-20171004][5], [thread][6]): an alternative document reader that supports epub, azw, pdf, djvu and many more
  * pbchess and CoolReader ([2017.10.14][7], [thread][8]): a chess program and another alternative reader, bundled together with several other games
  * kobohack ([web site][9]): I only use the ssh server
  * ssh access ([old post][10]: makes a full computer from your device by allowing you to log into it via ssh
  * custom dictionaries ([thread][11]): this fix updates dictionaries from the folder `customdicts` to the Kobo dictionary folder. For creating your own Japanese-English dictionary, see this [blog entry][12]
  * side-loaded fonts: GentiumBasic and GentiumBookBasic, Verdana, DroidSerif, and [Charter-eInk][13]

### Latest firmware

**Warning:** Sideloading or crossloading the incorrect firmware can
break/brick your device. The link below is for **Kobo GloHD ONLY**.

The first step is to update the Kobo to the latest firmware. This can easily
be done by just getting the latest firmware from the links above and unpacking
the zip file into the `.kobo` directory on your device. Eject and enjoy the
updating procedure.

### Mega update

Get the combined `KoboRoot.tgz` for your device from the links above and put
it into the `.kobo` directory, then eject and enjoy the updating procedure
again.

After this the device should reboot and you will be kicked into KSM, from
where after some time of waiting Nickel will be started. If you consider the
fonts too small, select `Configure`, then the `General`, and `add item`, then
select `kobomenuFontsize=55` and `save`.

## Remarks to some of the items included

The full list of included things is above, here are only some notes about what
specific I have done.

  * Metazoa firmware patches 

Included patches from the [Metazoa firmware patches][20]:
    
       [20]: <http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=260100>

    Custom left & right margins
    Fix three KePub fullScreenReading bugs
    Change dicthtml strings to micthtml
    Default ePub monospace font (Courier)
    Custom reading footer style
    Dictionary pop-up frame size increase

If you need/want different patches, you need to do the patching yourself.

  * kobohack-h 

[Kobohack][21] (latest version 20150110) originally provided updated libraries and optimizations, but unfortunately it is now completely outdated and using it is not recommended for the library part. I only include the ssh server (dropbear) so that connections to the Kobo via ssh. 

   [21]: <http://code.google.com/p/kobohack-j/>

  * ssh fixes 

See the detailed instructions [here][22], the necessary files are already
included in the mega upload. It updates the `/etc/inittab` to run also
`/etc/init.d/rcS2`, and this one again starts the `inetd` server and run user
supplied commands in `/mnt/onboard/run.sh` which is where your documents are.

   [22]: <https://www.preining.info/blog/2013/07/ssh-or-telnet-on-the-kobo-glo/> (ssh (or telnet) on the Kobo Glo)

  * Custom dictionaries 

The necessary directories and scripts are already included in the above
combined KoboRoot.tgz, so nothing to be done but dropping updated, fixed,
changed dictionaries into your Kobo root into the directory `customdict`.
After this you need to reboot to get the actual dictionaries updated. See this
[thread][23] for more information. The adaptions and script mentioned in [this
post][24] are included in the mega update.

## **WARNINGS**

If this is the first time you install this patch, you to fix the password for
root and disable telnet. This is an important step, here are the steps you
have to take (taken from [this old post][25]):

   [25]: <https://www.preining.info/blog/2013/07/ssh-or-telnet-on-the-kobo-glo/> (ssh (or telnet) on the Kobo Glo)

  1. Turn on Wifi on the Kobo and find IP address  
Go to Settings – Connect and after this is done, go to Settings – Device
Information where you will see something like`  
IP Address: 192.168.1.NN`  
(numbers change!)

  2. telnet into your device  
`telnet 192.168.1.NN`  
it will ask you the user name, enter “root” (without the quotes) and no
password

  3. (ON THE GLO) change home directory of root  
edit /etc/passwd with vi and change the entry for root by changing the 6th
field from: “/” to “/root” (without the quotes). After this procedure the line
should look like  
`root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh`  
don’t forget to save the file

  4. (ON THE GLO) create ssh keys for dropbear  
`[root@(none) ~]# mkdir /etc/dropbear  
[root@(none) ~]# cd /etc/dropbear  
[root@(none) ~]# dropbearkey -t dss -f dropbear_dss_host_key  
[root@(none) ~]# dropbearkey -t rsa -f dropbear_rsa_host_key`

  5. (ON YOUR PERSONAL COMPUTER) check that you can log in with ssh  
`ssh root@192.168.1.NN`  
You should get dropped into your device again

  6. (ON THE GLO) log out of the telnet session (the first one you did)  
`[root@(none) ~]# exit`

  7. (ON THE GLO) in your ssh session, change the password of root  
`[root@(none) ~]# passwd`  
you will have to enter the new password two times. Remember it well, you will
not be easily able to recover it without opening your device.

  8. (ON THE GLO) disable telnet login  
edit the file /etc/inetd.conf.local on the GLO (using vi) and remove the
telnet line (the line starting with 23).

  9. restart your device

The combined KoboRoot.tgz is provided without warranty. If you need to reset
your device, don’t blame me!

which percentage of Qt contributions came from people starting in KDE.
Basically, how many Qt contributions are made by people who used KDE as a

Many of these changes are made by people not directly as a result of their KDE
work, but as a result of their paid work. But this doesn’t change the fact
that KDE is an important project for attracting contributors to Qt, and a very
good place to find experienced Qt developers.

<li><p>From October 31st - November 2nd we will be holding the
<a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/events/berlin2017/">3rd Reproducible Builds summit</a>
in Berlin. If you are working in the field of reproducible builds, you should totally be
there. Please contact us if you have any questions! Quoting from the <a href="https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2017-October/000653.html">public invitation mail</a>:</p>

<pre><code>These dates are inclusive, ie. the summit will be 3 full days from "9 to 5".
Best arrive on Monday October 30th and leave on the evening of Thursday, 3rd
at the earliest.


Meeting content
===============

The exact content of the meeting is going to be shaped by the
participants, but here are the main goals:

 - Update &amp; exchange about the status of reproducible builds in various
   projects.
 - Establish spaces for more strategic and long-term thinking than is possible
   in virtual channels.
 - Improve collaboration both between and inside projects.
 - Expand the scope and reach of reproducible builds to more projects.
 - Brainstorming / Designing several things, eg:
  - designing tools enabling end-users to get the most benefits from
    reproducible builds.
  - design of back-ends needed for that.
 - Work together and hack on solutions.

There will be a huge variety of topics to be discussed. To give a few
examples:
- continuing design and development work on .buildinfo infrastructure
- build-path issues everywhere
- future directions for diffoscope, reprotest &amp; strip-nondeterminism
- reproducing signed artifacts such as RPMs
- discussing formats and tools we can share
- sharing proposals for standards and documentation helpful to spreading the
  reproducible effort
- and many many more.

Please think about what you want discuss, brainstorm &amp; learn about at this
meeting!


Schedule
========

Preliminary schedule for the three days:

9:00 Welcome and breakfast
9:30 Meeting starts
12:30 Lunch
17:00 End of the official schedule

Gunner and Beatrice from Aspiration will help running the meeting. We will
collect your input in subsequent emails to make the best of everyone's time.
Feel free to start thinking about what you want to achieve there. We will also
adjust topics as the meeting goes.

Please note that we are very likely to spend large parts of the meeting away
from laptops and closer to post-it notes. So make sure you've answered any
critical emails *before* Tuesday morning! :)

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/jmtd.png" width="65" height="85" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p><em>No spoilers, for those who have yet to watch it...</em></p>

<p>Channel 4 have been broadcasting a new 10-part series called <em>Electric Dreams</em>,
based on some of the short fiction of Philip K Dick. The series was
commissioned after Channel 4 lost <em>Black Mirror</em> to Netflix, perhaps to try and
find something tonally similar. <em>Electric Dreams</em> is executive-produced by
Brian Cranston, who also stars in one of the episodes yet to broadcast.</p>

<p>I've read all of PKD's short fiction<a class="footnote" href="http://jmtd.net/log/#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a> but it was a long time ago so I have
mostly forgotten the stories upon which the series is based. I've quite enjoyed
going back and re-reading them after watching the corresponding episodes to see
what changes they've made.  In some cases the changes are subtle or complementary,
in other cases they've whittled the original story right out and installed a new
one inside the shell. A companion compilation has been published with just the
relevant short stories in it, and from what I've seen browsing it in a book shop
it also contains short introductions which might be worth a read.</p>

<p>Things started strong with <em>The Hood Maker</em>, which my wife also enjoyed,
although she was disappointed to realise we wouldn't be revisiting those
characters in the future. The world-building was strong enough that it seemed
like a waste for a single episode.</p>

<p>My favourite episode of those broadcast so far was <em>The Commuter</em>, starring
Timothy Spall. The changes made were complementary and immensely expanded the
emotional range of the story. In some ways, a key aspect of the original story
was completely inverted, which I found quite funny: my original take on Dick's
story was Dick implying a particular outcome was horrific, whereas it becomes
desirable in the TV episode.</p>

<p>Episode 4, <em>Crazy Diamond</em></p>

<p>One of the stories most hollowed-out was <em>Sales Pitch</em> which was the basis for
Tony Grisoni’s episode <em>Crazy Diamond</em>, starring Steve Buscemi
and Sidse Babett Knudsen. Buscemi was good but Knudsen totally stole every
frame she was in.  Fans of the cancelled Channel 4 show <em>Utopia</em> should enjoy
this one: both were directed by Marc Munden and the directing, photography and
colour balance really recall it.</p>

<p>The last episode broadcast was <em>Real Life</em> directed by Ronald D Moore of
<em>Battlestar Galactica</em> reboot fame and starring Anna Paquin. Like <em>Sales Pitch</em>
it bears very little resemblance to the original story. It played around with
similar ideas explored in a lot of Sci-Fi movies and TV shows but left me a
little flat; I didn't think it contributed much that I hadn't seen before. I
was disappointed that there was a relatively conclusive ending. There was a
subversive humour in the Dick short that was completely lost in the retelling.
The world design seemed pretty generic.</p>

<p>
Confession time: I started making these posts (eons ago) because a close
friend did as well, and I enjoyed reading them.  But the main reason why I
continue is because the primary way I have to keep track of the books I've
bought and avoid duplicates is, well, grep on these posts.
</p>

<p>
I should come up with a non-bullshit way of doing this, but time to do
more elegant things is in short supply, and, well, it's my blog.  So I'm
boring all of you who read this in various places with my internal
bookkeeping.  I do try to at least add a bit of commentary.
</p>

<p>
This one will be more tedious than most since it includes five separate
<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/">Humble Bundles</a>, which
increases the volume a lot.  (I just realized I'd forgotten to record
those purchases from the past several months.)
</p>

Confession time: I started making these posts (eons ago) because a close
friend did as well, and I enjoyed reading them. But the main reason why I
continue is because the primary way I have to keep track of the books I've
bought and avoid duplicates is, well, grep on these posts.

I should come up with a non-bullshit way of doing this, but time to do more
elegant things is in short supply, and, well, it's my blog. So I'm boring all
of you who read this in various places with my internal bookkeeping. I do try
to at least add a bit of commentary.

This one will be more tedious than most since it includes five separate
[Humble Bundles][1], which increases the volume a lot. (I just realized I'd
forgotten to record those purchases from the past several months.)

   [1]: <https://www.humblebundle.com/books/>

Seanan McGuire — The Brightest Fell (sff)  
K. Arsenault Rivera — The Tiger's Daughter (sff)  
Matthew Walker — Why We Sleep (nonfiction)  

Some new books by favorite authors, a few new releases I heard good things
about, and two (Night Moves and Why We Sleep) from references in on-line
articles that impressed me.

For those who have been at the <a href="https://tug.org/tug2013/">TUG 2013</a> in Tokyo you will remember that the Japanese TeX community is quite big and vibrant. On Saturday about 50 users and developers gathered for a set of talks on a variety of topics.</p>
<p>The first talk was by <a href="https://www.lambdanote.com/">Keiichiro Shikano (鹿野 桂一郎)</a> on using Markup text to generate (La)TeX and HTML. He presented a variety of markup formats, including his own tool <a href="https://github.com/k16shikano/xml2tex">xml2tex</a>.</p>
<p>The second talk was my <a href="http://www.trueroad.jp/">Masamichi Hosoda (細田 真道)</a> on reducing the size of PDF files using PDFmark extraction. As a contributor to many projects including <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/">Texinfo</a> and <a href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a>, Masamichi Hosoda tells us horror stories about multiple font embedding in the manual of LilyPond, the permanent need for adaption to newer <a href="https://www.ghostscript.com/">Ghostscript</a> versions, and the very recent development in Ghostscript prohibiting the merge of font definitions in PDF files.</p>
<p>Next up was Yusuke Terada (寺田 侑祐) on grading exams using TeX. Working through hundreds and hundreds of exams and do the grading is something many of us are used to and I think nobody really enjoys it. Yusuke Terada has combined various tools, including scans, pdf merging using pdfpages, to generate gradable PDF which were then checked on an iPad. On the way he did hit some limits in dvipdfmx on the number of images, but this was obviously only a small bump on the road. Now if that could be automatized as a nice application, it would be a big hit I guess!</p>
<p>The forth talk was by Satoshi Yamashita (山下 哲) on the preparation of slides using <a href="http://ketpic.com/">KETpic</a>. KETpic is a long running project by Setsuo Takato (高遠節夫) for the generation of graphics, in particular using <a href="https://www.cinderella.de/">Cinderella</a>. KETpic and KETcindy integrates with lots of algebraic and statistical programs (R, Maxima, SciLab, …) and has a long history of development. Currently there are activities to incorporate it into TeX Live.</p>
<p>The fifth talk was by Takuto Asakura (朝倉 卓人) on programming TeX using <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/expl3">expl3</a>, the main building block of the <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/latex3/">LaTeX3 project</a> and already adopted by many TeX developers. Takuto Asakura came to fame on this years <a href="http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2017-en/">TUG/BachoTeX 2017</a> when he won the <a href="http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/wjmartin-en">W. J. Martin Prize</a> for his presentation <a href="http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2017-en/program#Asakura_1">Implementing bioinformatics algorithms in TeX</a>. I think we can expect great new developments from Takuto!</p>
<p>The last talk was by myself on fmtutil and updmap, two of the main management programs in any TeX installation, presenting the changes introduced over the last year, including the most recent release of TeX Live. Details have been posted on my blog, and a lengthy <a href="https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb38-2/tb119preining.pdf">article</a> in <a href="https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb38-2/">TUGboat 38:2, 2017</a> is available on this topic, too.</p>
<p>After the conference about half of the participants joined a social dinner in a nearby Izakaya, followed by a after-dinner beer tasting at a local craft beer place. Thanks to Tatsuyoshi Hamada for the organization.</p>

Last saturday the [Japanese TeX User Meeting][1] took place in Fujisawa,
Kanagawa. For those who have been at the [TUG 2013][2] in Tokyo you will
remember that the Japanese TeX community is quite big and vibrant. On Saturday
about 50 users and developers gathered for a set of talks on a variety of

<p>Two months ago, Troy Hunt, the security professional behind
<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I been pwned?</a>,
<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/">released</a>
an incredibly comprehensive
<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">password list</a> in the hope that it
would allow web developers to steer their users away from passwords that
have been compromised in past breaches.</p>

<p>While the list released by HIBP is hashed, the plaintext passwords are out
there and one should assume that password crackers have access to them.
So if you use a password on that list, you can be fairly confident
that it's very easy to guess or crack your password.</p>

<p>I wanted to check my <strong>active</strong> passwords against that list to check whether
or not any of them are compromised and should be changed immediately. This
meant that I needed to download the list and do these lookups locally since
it's not a good idea to send your current passwords to this third-party
service.</p>

<p>I put my tool up on <a href="https://launchpad.net/hibp-pwlookup">Launchpad</a> /
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hibp-pwlookup">PyPI</a> and you are more than
welcome to give it a go. Install <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> and

<p>
I said that I was going to start writing these regularly, so I'm going to
stick to it, even when the results are rather underwhelming.  One of the
goals is to make the time for more free software work, and I do better at
doing things that I record.
</p>

<p>
The only piece of free software work for September was that I made
<a href="https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/">rra-c-util</a> compile cleanly with the
Clang static analyzer.  This was fairly tedious work that mostly involved
unconfusing the compiler or converting (semi-intentional) crashes into
explicit asserts, but it unblocks using the Clang static analyzer as part
of the automated test suite of my other projects that are downstream of
rra-c-util.
</p>

<p>
One of the semantic changes I made was that the vector utilities in
rra-c-util (which maintain a resizable array of strings) now always
allocate room for at least one string pointer.  This wastes a small amount
of memory for empty vectors that are never used, but ensures that the
<code>strings</code> struct member is always valid.  This isn't, strictly
speaking, a correctness fix, since all the checks were correct, but after
some thought, I decided that humans might have the same problem that the
static analyzer had.  It's a lot easier to reason about a field that's
never NULL.  Similarly, the replacement function for a missing
<code>reallocarray</code> now does an allocation of size 1 if given a size of 0,
just to avoid edge case behavior.  (I'm sure the behavior of a realloc
with size 0 is defined somewhere in the C standard, but if I have to look
it up, I'd rather not make a human reason about it.)
</p>

<p>
I started on, but didn't finish, making rra-c-util compile without Clang
warnings (at least for a chosen set of warnings).  By far the hardest
problem here are the Clang warnings for comparisons between unsigned and
signed integers.  In theory, I like this warning, since it's the cause of
a lot of very obscure bugs.  In practice, gah does C ever do this all over
the place, and it's incredibly painful to avoid.  (One of the biggest
offenders is <code>write</code>, which returns a <code>ssize_t</code> that you almost
always want to compare against a <code>size_t</code>.)  I did a bunch of
mechanical work, but I now have a lot of bits of code like:
</p>

<pre>     if (status &lt; 0)
         return;
    written = (size_t) status;
    if (written &lt; avail)
        buffer-&gt;left += written;
</pre>

<p>
which is ugly and unsatisfying.  And I also have a ton of casts, such as
with:
</p>

<pre>    buffer_resize(buffer, (size_t) st.st_size + used);
</pre>

<p>
since <code>st.st_size</code> is an <code>off_t</code>, which may be signed.  This is
all deeply unsatisfying and ugly, and I think it makes the code moderately
harder to read, but I do think the warning will potentially catch bugs and
even security issues.
</p>

<p>
I'm still torn.  Maybe I can find some nice macros or programming styles
to avoid the worst of this problem.  It definitely requires more thought,
rather than just committing this huge mechanical change with lots of ugly
code.
</p>

<p>
Mostly, this kind of nonsense makes me want to stop working on C code and
go finish learning Rust....
</p>

<p>
Anyway, apart from work, the biggest thing I managed to do last month that
was vaguely related to free software was upgrading my personal servers to
stretch (finally).  That mostly went okay; only a few things made it
unnecessarily exciting.
</p>

<p>
The first was that one of my systems had a very tiny / partition that was
too small to hold the downloaded debs for the upgrade, so I had to resize
it (VM disk, partition, and file system), and that was a bit exciting
because it has an old-style DOS partition table that isn't aligned (hmmm,
which is probably why disk I/O is so slow on those VMs), so I had to use
the obsolete <code>fdisk -c=dos</code> mode because I wasn't up for replacing
the partition right then.
</p>

<p>
The second was that my first try at an upgrade died with a segfault during
the libc6 postinst and then every executable segfaulted.  A mild panic and
a rescue disk later (and thirty minutes and a lot of swearing), I tracked
the problem down to libc6-xen.  Nothing in the dependency structure
between jessie and stretch forces libc6-xen to be upgraded in lockstep or
removed, but it's earlier in the search path.  So ld.so gets upgraded, and
then finds the old libc6 from the libc6-xen package, and the mismatch
causes immediate segfaults.  A <code>chroot dpkg --purge</code> from the rescue
disk solved the problem as soon as I knew what was going on, but that was
a stressful half-hour.
</p>

<p>
The third problem was something I should have known was going to be an
issue: an old Perl program that does some internal stuff for one of the
services I ran had a <code>defined @array</code> test that has been warning for
eons and that I never fixed.  That became a full syntax error with the
most recent Perl, and then I fixed it incorrectly the first time and had a
bunch of trouble tracking down what I'd broken.  All sorted out now, and
everything is happily running stretch.  (ejabberd, which other folks had
mentioned was a problem, went completely smoothly, although I suspect I
now have too many of the plugin packages installed and should do a
purging.)

I said that I was going to start writing these regularly, so I'm going to
stick to it, even when the results are rather underwhelming. One of the goals
is to make the time for more free software work, and I do better at doing
things that I record.

The only piece of free software work for September was that I made [rra-c-
util][1] compile cleanly with the Clang static analyzer. This was fairly
tedious work that mostly involved unconfusing the compiler or converting
(semi-intentional) crashes into explicit asserts, but it unblocks using the
Clang static analyzer as part of the automated test suite of my other projects
that are downstream of rra-c-util.

   [1]: <https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/>

One of the semantic changes I made was that the vector utilities in rra-c-util
(which maintain a resizable array of strings) now always allocate room for at
least one string pointer. This wastes a small amount of memory for empty
vectors that are never used, but ensures that the `strings` struct member is
always valid. This isn't, strictly speaking, a correctness fix, since all the
checks were correct, but after some thought, I decided that humans might have
the same problem that the static analyzer had. It's a lot easier to reason
about a field that's never NULL. Similarly, the replacement function for a
missing `reallocarray` now does an allocation of size 1 if given a size of 0,
just to avoid edge case behavior. (I'm sure the behavior of a realloc with
size 0 is defined somewhere in the C standard, but if I have to look it up,
I'd rather not make a human reason about it.)

I started on, but didn't finish, making rra-c-util compile without Clang
warnings (at least for a chosen set of warnings). By far the hardest problem
here are the Clang warnings for comparisons between unsigned and signed
integers. In theory, I like this warning, since it's the cause of a lot of
very obscure bugs. In practice, gah does C ever do this all over the place,
and it's incredibly painful to avoid. (One of the biggest offenders is
`write`, which returns a `ssize_t` that you almost always want to compare
against a `size_t`.) I did a bunch of mechanical work, but I now have a lot of
bits of code like:

    
    
         if (status < 0)
             return;
        written = (size_t) status;
        if (written < avail)
            buffer->left += written;
    

which is ugly and unsatisfying. And I also have a ton of casts, such as with:

    
    
        buffer_resize(buffer, (size_t) st.st_size + used);
    

since `st.st_size` is an `off_t`, which may be signed. This is all deeply
unsatisfying and ugly, and I think it makes the code moderately harder to
read, but I do think the warning will potentially catch bugs and even security
issues.

I'm still torn. Maybe I can find some nice macros or programming styles to
avoid the worst of this problem. It definitely requires more thought, rather
than just committing this huge mechanical change with lots of ugly code.

Mostly, this kind of nonsense makes me want to stop working on C code and go
finish learning Rust....

Anyway, apart from work, the biggest thing I managed to do last month that was
vaguely related to free software was upgrading my personal servers to stretch
(finally). That mostly went okay; only a few things made it unnecessarily
exciting.

The first was that one of my systems had a very tiny / partition that was too

disk, partition, and file system), and that was a bit exciting because it has
an old-style DOS partition table that isn't aligned (hmmm, which is probably
why disk I/O is so slow on those VMs), so I had to use the obsolete `fdisk
-c=dos` mode because I wasn't up for replacing the partition right then.

I was wondering for quite some time why on my server vim behaves so stupid
with respect to the mouse: Jumping around, copy and paste wasn’t possible the
usual way. All this despite having

    
    
      set mouse=
    

in my `/etc/vim/vimrc.local`. Finally I found out why, thanks to bug
[#864074][1] and fixed it.

   [1]: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=864074>

The whole mess comes from the fact that, when there is no `~/.vimrc`, vim
loads `defaults.vim` **after** ` vimrc.local` and thus overwriting several
settings put in there.

There is a comment (I didn’t see, though) in `/etc/vim/vimrc` explaining this:

    
    
    " Vim will load $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim if the user does not have a vimrc.
    " This happens after /etc/vim/vimrc(.local) are loaded, so it will override
    " any settings in these files.
    " If you don't want that to happen, uncomment the below line to prevent
    " defaults.vim from being loaded.
    " let g:skip_defaults_vim = 1
    

I agree that this is a good way to setup vim on a normal installation of Vim,
but the Debian package could do better. The problem is laid out clearly in the
bug report: If there is no `~/.vimrc`, settings in `/etc/vim/vimrc.local` are
overwritten.

This is as counterintuitive as it can be in Debian – and I don’t know any
other package that does it in a similar way.

Since the settings in `defaults.vim` are quite reasonable, I want to have
them, but only fix a few of the items I disagree with, like the mouse. At the
end what I did is the following in my `/etc/vim/vimrc.local`:

    
    
    if filereadable("/usr/share/vim/vim80/defaults.vim")
      source /usr/share/vim/vim80/defaults.vim
    endif
    " now set the line that the defaults file is not reloaded afterwards!
    let g:skip_defaults_vim = 1
    
    " turn of mouse
    set mouse=
    " other override settings go here
    

There is probably a better way to get a generic load statement that does not
depend on the Vim version, but for now I am fine with that.

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/irl.png" width="80" height="80" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>Here’s my weekly report for week 41 of 2017. In this week I have explored some
<a href="https://iain.learmonth.me/blog/2017/2017w413/">Java 8</a>
<a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/2017/2017w414/">features</a>, looked at <a href="https://iain.learmonth.me/blog/2017/2017w412/">automatic
updates in a few Linux distributions</a> and decided that
actually <a href="https://iain.learmonth.me/blog/2017/2017w415/">I don’t need swap anymore</a>.</p>

<h2 id="debian">Debian</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?109385">issue that was preventing the
migration</a> of the <a href="https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=pkg-tasktools-discuss@lists.alioth.debian.org">Tasktools Packaging
Team</a>’s
mailing list <a href="https://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/pkg-tasktools-discuss">from
Alioth</a>
<a href="https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/taskdeb-discuss">to Savannah</a> has
now been resolved.</p>

<p><a href="https://a.custura.eu/">Ana</a>’s 
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/chkservice">chkservice</a>

 package that I
sponsored last week has been <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/878064">ACCEPTED</a>
into unstable and since <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/879426">MIGRATED</a> to
testing.</p>

<h2 id="tor-project">Tor Project</h2>

<p>I have produced a patch for the Tor Project website to update links to the
Onionoo documentation now this has moved (<a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/23802">#23802</a>
). I’ve
updated the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-relay-debian.html.en">Debian and Ubuntu relay configuration
instructions</a> to use
<code>systemctl</code> instead of <code>service</code> where appropriate (<a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/23048">#23048</a>
).</p>

<p>When a Tor relay is less than 2 years old, an alert will now appear on
<a href="https://atlas.torproject.org">Atlas</a> to link to the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/lifecycle-new-relay">new relay
lifecycle</a> blog post (<a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/23767">#23767</a>
). This should hopefully help new relay operators understand why
their relay is not immediately fully loaded but instead it takes some time to
ramp up.</p>

<p>I have gone through the tickets for <a href="https://cloud.torproject.org/">Tor Cloud</a>
and did not find any tickets that contain any important information that would
be useful to someone reviving the project. I have closed out these tickets and
the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=closed&amp;component=Archived%2FTor+Cloud&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=changetime&amp;desc=1&amp;order=changetime">Tor Cloud

).</p>

<p>I’ve continued to work on turning the Atlas application into an integrated part
of Tor Metrics (<a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/23518">#23518</a>
) and you can see some progress
<a href="https://people.torproject.org/~irl/atlas/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I’ve continued hacking on a <a href="https://twitter.com/TorAtlas">Twitter bot to tweet factoids about the public
Tor network</a> and you can now enjoy <a href="https://people.torproject.org/~irl/atlasbot/">some JavaDoc
documentation</a> if you’d like to
learn a little about its internals. I am still waiting for a git repository to
be created (<a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/23799">#23799</a>
) but will be publishing the sources shortly
after that ticket is actioned.</p>

<h2 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h2>

<p>I believe it is important to be clear not only about the work I have already
completed but also about the sustainability of this work into the future. I
plan to include a short report on the current sustainability of my work in each
weekly report.</p>

<p>I have not had any free software related expenses this week. The current funds
I have available for equipment, travel and other free software expenses remains
£60.52. I do not believe that any hardware I rely on is looking at imminent
failure.</p>

<p>I’d like to thank <a href="http://digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> for providing me
with futher credit for their platform to support my open source work.</p>

<p>I do not find it likely that I’ll be travelling to Cambridge for <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/gb/2017/MiniDebConfCambridge">the
miniDebConf</a>
as the train alone would be around £350 and hotel accomodation a further £600
(to include both me and Ana).</p>

I’ve continued to work on turning the Atlas application into an integrated
part of Tor Metrics ([#23518][35] ) and you can see some progress [here][36].

Finally, I’ve continued hacking on a [Twitter bot to tweet factoids about the
public Tor network][37] and you can now enjoy [some JavaDoc documentation][38]
if you’d like to learn a little about its internals. I am still waiting for a
git repository to be created ([#23799][39] ) but will be publishing the
sources shortly after that ticket is actioned.

## Sustainability

I believe it is important to be clear not only about the work I have already
completed but also about the sustainability of this work into the future. I
plan to include a short report on the current sustainability of my work in
each weekly report.

I have not had any free software related expenses this week. The current funds
I have available for equipment, travel and other free software expenses
remains £60.52. I do not believe that any hardware I rely on is looking at
imminent failure.

I’d like to thank [Digital Ocean][61] for providing me with futher credit for
their platform to support my open source work.

   [61]: <http://digitalocean.com/>

I do not find it likely that I’ll be travelling to Cambridge for [the
miniDebConf][62] as the train alone would be around £350 and hotel
accomodation a further £600 (to include both me and Ana).

https://www.preining.info/blog/2017/10/tex-live-manager-json-output/

With the development of [TLCockpit][1] continuing, I found the need for and
easy exchange format between the [TeX Live Manager][2] `tlmgr` and frontend
programs like TLCockpit. Thus, I have implemented JSON output for the `tlmgr
info` command.

   [1]: <https://github.com/TeX-Live/tlcockpit>
   [2]: <https://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>

While the format is not 100% stable – I might change some thing – I consider
it pretty settled. The output of `tlmgr info --data json` is a JSON array with
JSON objects for each package requested (default is to list all).

    
    
    [ TLPackageObj, TLPackageObj, ... ]
    

The structure of the JSON object `TLPackageObj` reflects the internal Perl
hash. Guaranteed to be present keys are `name` (String) and `avilable`
(Boolean). In case the package is available, there are the following further
keys sorted by their type:

  * **String type:** name, shortdesc, longdesc, category, catalogue, containerchecksum, srccontainerchecksum, doccontainerchecksum
  * **Number type:** revision, runsize, docsize, srcsize, containersize, srccontainersize, doccontainersize
  * **Boolean type:** available, installed, relocated
  * **Array type:** runfiles (Strings), docfiles (Strings), srcfiles (Strings), executes (Strings), depends (Strings), postactions (Strings)
  * **Object type:**
    * binfiles: keys are architecture names, values are arrays of strings (list of binfiles)
    * binsize: keys are architecture names, values or numbers
    * docfiledata: keys are docfile names, values are objects with optional keys `details` and `lang`
    * cataloguedata: optional keys aare `topics`, `version`, `license`, `ctan`, `date`, values are all strings

A rather long example showing the output for the package `latex`, formatted
with `json_pp` and having the list of files and the long description
shortened:

    
    
    [
       {
          "installed" : true,
          "doccontainerchecksum" : "5bdfea6b85c431a0af2abc8f8df160b297ad73f6a324ca88df990f01f24611c9ae80d2f6d12c7b3767308fbe3de3fca3d11664b923ea4080fb13fd056a1d0c3d",
          "docfiles" : [
             "texmf-dist/doc/latex/base/README.txt",
             ....
             "texmf-dist/doc/latex/base/webcomp.pdf"
          ],
          "containersize" : 163892,
          "depends" : [
             "luatex",
             "pdftex",
             "latexconfig",
             "latex-fonts"
          ],

          ],
          "shortdesc" : "A TeX macro package that defines LaTeX"
       }
    ]
    

What is currently not available via `tlmgr info` and thus also not via the
JSON output is access to virtual TeX Live databases with several member
databases (multiple repositories). I am thinking about how to incorporate this
information.

These changes are currently available in the [tlcritical][3] repository, but
will enter proper TeX Live repositories soon.

   [3]: <https://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>

Using this JSON output I will rewrite the current TLCockpit tlmgr interface to
display more complete information.

<p>I find it fascinating how many of the people being locked inside

the “Antifascist Bulwark” after erecting the Berlin Wall, claiming
that the wall was erected to keep enemies from creeping into East
Germany, while it was obvious to the people locked inside it that it
was erected to keep the people from escaping.</p>

<p>Do the people in USA supporting this wall really believe it is a

If you read [Planet Debian][1] often, you’ve probably noticed a trend of Free
Software activity reports at the beginning of the month. First, those reports
seemed a bit unamusing and lengthy, but since I take the time to read them
I’ve learnt a lot of things, and now I’m amazed at the amount of work that
people are doing for Free Software. Indeed, I knew already that many people
are doing lots of work. But reading those reports gives you an actual view of
how much it is.

   [1]: <http://planet.debian.org/>

Then, I decided that I should do the same and write some kind of report since
I became a [Debian Developer][2] in July. I think it’s a nice way to share
your work with others and maybe inspire them as it happened to me. So I asked
some of the people that have been inspiring me how do they do it. I mean, I
was curious to know how they keep track of the work they do and how long it
takes to write their reports. It seems that it takes quite some time, it’s
mostly manual work and usually starts by the end of the month, reviewing their
contributions in mailing lists, bug trackers, e-mail folders, etc.

   [2]: <https://bits.debian.org/2017/07/new-developers-2017-06.html>

Here I am now, writing my first report about my Free Software activities since
July and until September 2017. I hope you like it:

  * Filed [bug #867068][3] in **nm.debian.org** : _Cannot claim account after former SSO alioth cert expired_.
  * Replied a request in private mail for becoming the maintainer for the Monero Wallet, that I declined suggesting to file an [RFP][4].

  * Suggested to remove **libmail-sender-perl** in [bug #790727][11], since it’s been deprecated upstream.
  * Mentioned `-n` option for `dpt-takeover` in [how to adopt][12] pkg-perl manual.
  * Fixed a broken link to [HCL][13] in <https://wiki.debian.org/Hardware>.
  * Adopted **libapache-admin-config-perl** into pkg-perl team, [upgraded][14] to 0.95-1 and closed [bug #615457][15].
  * Fixed [bug #875835][16] in **libflickr-api-perl** : _don’t add quote marks in SYNOPSIS_.

Today we received updates on the OpenSSL 1.0 removal status:  
  
<<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=828522#206>>  
<<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=859671#19>>  
  
So those removal bugs' severities will be raised to RC in aproximately a
month.  
  
We still don't have any solutions for Qt 4 or 5.  
  
For the Qt 5 case we will probably keep the bug open until Qt 5.10 is in the
archive which should bring OpenSSL 1.1 support ***or*** FTP masters decide to
remove OpenSSL1.0. In this last case the fate will be the same as with Qt4,
below.  
  
For Qt4 we do not have patches available and there will probably be none in
time (remember we do not have upstream support). That plus the fact that we
are actively trying to remove it from the archive it means we will remove
openssl support. This might mean that apps using Qt4:  
  
\- Might cease to work.  
\- Might keep working:  
\- Informing their users that no SSL support is available → programmer did a
good job.  
\- Not informing their users that no SSL support is available and establishing
connections non the less → programmer might have not done a good job.  
  
Trying to inform users as soon as possible,

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/shirish.png" width="80" height="80" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>This would be a longish blog post (as most of mine are) compiled over days but as there is so short a time and so much to share.</p>
<p>I had previously thought to share beautiful photographs of Ganesh mandals taking out the procession at time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesh_Chaturthi#In_public" rel="noopener" target="_blank">immersion</a> of the idol or the last day of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Durga Puja</a> recent events around do not make my mood to share photos at this point in time. I may share some of them in a future blog post or two .</p>
<p>Before going further, I would like to offer my sympathies and condolences to people hurt and dislocated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hurricane Irma</a> , the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Central_Mexico_earthquake" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2017 Central Mexico Earthquake</a> and lastly the most recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_Strip_shooting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Las Vegas shooting</a> as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hurricane Maria</a> in Puerto Rico . I am somewhat nonplussed as to why Americans always want to name, especially hurricanes which destroy people’s lives and livelihood built over generations and why most of the hurricanes are named after women. A look at weather.com <a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/tropical-storm-hurricane-names-20130626#/!" rel="noopener" target="_blank">site</a> unveiled the answer to the mystery.</p>
<p>Ironically (or not) I saw some of the best science coverage about Earthquakes or anything scientific reporting and analysis after a long time in mainstream newspapers in India.</p>
<p>On another note, I don’t understand or even expect to understand why the gunman did what he did 2 days back. Country music AFAIK is one of the most chilled-out kind of music, in some ways very similar to classical Indian singing although they are worlds apart in style of singing, renditions, artists, the way they emote etc. I seriously wish that the gunman had not been shot but caught and reasons were sought about what he did, he did. While this is certainly armchair thinking as was not at the scene of crime, but if a Mumbai Police constable could do it around a decade <a>ago</a> armed only with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick-fighting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lathi</a> could do it, why couldn’t the American cops who probably are trained in innumerable ways to subdue people without killing them, did. While investigations are on, I suspect if he were caught just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajmal_Kasab" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ajmal Kasab</a> was caught then lot of revelations might have come up. From what is known, the gentleman was upwardly mobile i.e. he was white, rich and apparently had no reason to have beef with anybody especially a crowd swaying to some nice music, all of which makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p><strong>Indian Economy ‘Slowdown’</strong></p>
<p>Anyways, back to one of the main reasons of writing this blog post. Few days back, an ex-finance Minister of India <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashwant_Sinha" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yashwant Sinha</a> wrote what was felt by probably millions of Indians, an Indian Express article called ‘<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/yashwant-sinha-arun-jaitley-gst-demonetisation-narendra-modi-economy-bjp-i-need-to-speak-up-now-4862716/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I need to speak up now</a>‘</p>
<p>While there have been many, many arguments made since then by various people. A simple search of ‘I need to speak up’ would lead to lead to many a result besides the one I have shared above. The only exception I have with the article is the line “Forty leading companies of the country are already facing bankruptcy proceedings. Many more are likely to follow suit.” I would not bore you but you ask any entrepreneur trying to set up shop in India i.e. ones who actually go through the processes of getting all the licenses for setting up even a small businesses as to the numerous hurdles they have to overcome and laid-back corrupt bureaucracy which they have to overcome. I could have interviewed some of my friends who had the conviction and the courage to set up shop and spent more than half a decade getting all the necessary licenses and approval to set up but it probably would be too specific for one industry or the other and would lead to the same result.</p>
<p>Co-incidentally, a new restaurant, <a href="https://www.zomato.com/pune/the-leaf-shivaji-nagar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leaf</a> opened in my vicinity few weeks before. From the looks it looked like a high-brow, high-priced restaurant hence like many others I did not venture in. After a few days, they introduced south-Indian delicacies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_dosa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Masala Dosa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttapam" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Uttapam</a> at prices similar to other restaurants around. So I ventured in and bought some south Indian food to consume between mum and me.</p>
<p>Few days later, I became friends with the owner/franchisee and I suggested (in a friendly tone) that why he doesn’t make it like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Coffee_Day" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CCD</a> play where many people including yours truly use the service to share, strategize and meet with clients.</p>
<p>The CCD joints usually serve coffee and snacks (which are over-priced but still run out pretty fast) but people come as they have chilled-out atmosphere and Wi-Fi access which people need for their smartphones, although the Wi-Fi part may soon become redundant With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jio" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reliance Jio</a> making a big play.</p>
<p>I also shared why he doesn’t add more variety and time (the south Indian items are time-limited) as I see/saw many empty chairs there.</p>
<p>Anyways, the shop-owner/franchisee shared his gross costs including salary, stocking, electricity, rent and it doesn’t pan out to be serving Rs.80/- dish (roughly a 1US dollar and 25 cents) then serving INR Rs. 400/- a dish (around 6 $USD). One round of INR 400/- + dishes make his costs for the day, around 12 tables were there. It’s when they have two full rounds of dishes costing INR 400/- or more that he actually has profits and he is predicting loss for at least 6 months to a year before he makes a rebound. He needs steady customers rather than just walk-ins that will make his business work/click. Currently his family is bearing the costs. He didn’t mention the taxes although I know apart from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GST</a> there are still some local body taxes that they will have to pay and comply with.</p>
<p>There are a multitude of problems for shutting a shop legally as well as they have to again renavigate the bureaucracy for the same. I have seen more than a few retailers downing their shutters for 6-8 months and then either sell it to new management, let go of the lease or simply sell the property to a competitor. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency_and_Bankruptcy_Code" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code</a> is probably the first proper exit policy for large companies. So the 40 odd companies that Mr. Sinha were talking about were probably sick for a long time.</p>
<p>In India, there is also an additional shame of being a failed entrepreneur unlike in the west where Entrepreneurs start on their next venture. As seen from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retailing_in_India" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Retailing In India</a> only 3.3% of the population or at the most 4% of the population is directly or indirectly linked with the retail trade. Most of the economy still derives its wealth from the agrarian sector which is still reeling under the pressure from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demonetization</a> which happened last year.

Because of the South African Debconf, I had to resort to debit cards and hence was able to escape standing in long lines in which many an old and women perished.</p>
<p>It is only yesterday that the Government has acknowledged which many prominent Indians have been saying for months now, that we are in a ‘<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/can-india-beat-this-slowdown/article8245411.ece" rel="noopener" target="_blank">slowdown</a>‘.

The only bright spot has been e-commerce which so far has eluded GST although the Govt. has claimed regulations to put it in check.</p>
<p><strong>Indian Education System </strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravish_Kumar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ravish Kumar</a> has started a series on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV_India" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NDTV</a> where he is showcasing how Indian education sector, especially public colleges have been left to teachers on contract basis, see the first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7-GQH-G-Ns&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLpSN4vP31-KvMP3DLA3vnPVtPHb-FtRA2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">four episodes</a> on NDTV channel starting with the first one I have shared as a hyperlink. I apologize as the series is in Hindi as the channel is meant for Indians and is mostly limited to Northern areas of the Country (mostly) although he has been honest that it is because they lack resources to tackle the amount of information flowing to them. Ravish started the series with sharing information about the U.S. where the things are similar with some <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/local/article/High-cost-of-living-forces-San-Jose-State-12164855.php" rel="noopener" target="_blank">teachers</a> needing to sleep in cars because of high-cost of living to some needing to turn to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/adjunct-professors-homeless-sex-work-academia-poverty" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sex-work</a> . I was shocked when I read the guardian article, that is no way to treat our teachers.I went on to read <a href="https://junctrebellion.wordpress.com/how-the-american-university-was-killed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">‘How the American University was Killed</a>‘ following the breadcrumbs along the way. Reading that it seems Indians have been following the American system playbook from the 1980’s itself. The article talks about HMO as well and that seems to have followed here as well with my own experience of hospital fees and drugs which I had to entail a few weeks/month ago.</p>
<p>Few years ago, when me and some of my friends had the teaching bug and we started teaching in a nearby municipal school, couple of teachers had shared that they were doing 2-3 jobs to make ends meet. I don’t know about others in my group, at least I was cynical because I thought all the teachers were permanent and they make good money only to realize now that the person was probably speaking the truth. When you have to do three jobs to make ends meet from where do you bring the passion to teach young people and that too outside the syllabus ?</p>
<p>Also, with this new knowledge in hindsight, I take back all my comments I made last year and the year before for the pathetic education being put up by the State. With teachers being paid pathetically/underpaid and almost 60% teachers being ad-hoc/adjunct teachers they have to find ways to have some sense of security. Most teachers are bachelors as they are poor and cannot offer any security (either male or female) and for women, after marriage it actually makes no sense for them to continue in this profession. I salute all the professors who are ad-hoc in nature and probably will never get a permanent position in their life.</p>
<p>I think in some way, thanx to him, that the government has chosen to give <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-7th-pay-commission-early-diwali-for-8-lakh-teachers-as-govt-approves-pay-hike-2552286" rel="noopener" target="_blank">7th pay commisson salary</a> to teachers. While the numbers may appear be large, there are a lot of questions as to how many people will actually get paid. There needs to be lot of vacancies which need to be filled quickly but don’t see any solution in the next 2-3 years as well. The Government has taken a position to use/re-hire retired teachers rather than have new young teachers as an unwritten policy. In this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_India" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digital India</a> context how are retired teachers supposed to understand and then pass on digital concepts is beyond me when at few teacher trainings I have seen they lack even the most basic knowledge that I learnt at least a decade or two ago, the difference is that vast. I just don’t know what to say to that. My own experience with my own mother who had pretty good education in her time and probably would have made a fine business-woman if she knew that she will have a child that she would have to raise by herself alone (along with maternal grand-parents) is testimonial to the fact how hard it is for older people to grasp technology and here I’m talking just using the interface as a consumer rather than a producer or someone in-between who has the idea of how companies and governments profit from whatever data is shared one way or the other. </p>
<p>After watching the series/episodes and discussing the issue with my mother it was revealed that both her and my late maternal grandfather were on casual/ad-hoc basis till 20-25 years in their service in the defense sector. If Ravish were to do a series on the defense sector he probably would find the same thing there. To add to that, the defense sector is a vital component to a country’s security. If 60% of the defense staff in all defense establishments have temporary staff how do you ensure the loyalty of the people working therein. That brings to my mind ‘Ignorance is bliss’.</p>
<p><strong> Software development and deployment </strong></p>
<p>There is another worry that all are skirting around, the present dispensation/government’s mantra is ‘minimum government-maximum governance’ with digital technologies having all solutions which is leading to massive unemployment. Also from most of the stories/incidents I read in the newspapers, mainstream media and elsewhere it seems most software deployments done in India are done without having any system of internal checks and balances. There is no ‘<a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/lintian" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lintian</a>‘ for software to be implemented. Contracts seem to be given to big companies and there is no mention of what prerequisites or conditions were laid down by the Government for software development and deployment and if any checks were done to ensure that the software being developed was in according to government specifications or not. Ideally this should all be in public domain so that questions can be asked and responsibility fixed if things go haywire, as currently they do not.</p>
<p><strong>Software issue</strong>s</p>
<p>As my health been not that great, I have been taking a bit more time and depth while filing bugs. <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=877638" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#877638</a> is a good example. I suspect though that part of the problem might be that mate has moved to gtk3 while guake still has gtk-2 bindings. I also reported the issue upstream both in <a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-panel/issues/666" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mate-panel</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-panel/issues/666" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guake</a> . I haven’t received any response from either <a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-panel/issues/666" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> or/and </a> <a>upstreams </a>.</p>
<p>I also have been fiddling around with gdb to better understand the tool so I can exploit/use this tool in a better way. There are some commands within the gdb interface which seem to be interesting and hopefully I’ll try how the commands perform over days, weeks to a month. I hope we see more action on the mate-panel/guake bug as well as move of guake to gtk+3 but that what seemingly seemed like wait for <a href="https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Guake+3+Rewrite%22" rel="noopener" target="_blank">eternity</a> seems to have <a href="https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1009" rel="noopener" target="_blank">done</a> by somebody in last couple of days. As shared in the ticket there are lots of things still to do but it seems the heavy lifting has been done but seems merging will be tricky as two developers have been trying to update to gtk+3 although <a href="https://github.com/aichingm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">aichingm </a> seems to have a leg up with his <a href="https://github.com/aichingm/guake/tree/3!" rel="noopener" target="_blank">3!</a> branch.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing I saw is the below picture. </p>
<p><img alt="Firefox is out of date on wordpress.com" src="https://flossexperiences.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/wordpress-dashboard-firefox-lts-out-of-date.png?w=538" /></p>
<p>The firefox version I was using to test the site/wordpress-wp-admin was Mozilla Firefox 52.4.0 which AFAIK is a pretty recentish one and people using Debian stretch would probably be using the same version (firefox stable/LTS) rather than the more recent versions. I went to the link it linked <a href="http://browsehappy.com/?locale=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to</a> and it gave no indication as to why it thought my browser is out-of-date and what functionality was/is missing. I have found that wordpress support has declined quite a bit and people don’t seem to use the forums as much as they used to before. </p>
<p>I also filed a few bugs for qalculate. <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/877716" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#877716</a> where a supposedly transitional package removes the actual application, <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/877717" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#877717</a> as the software has moved its repo. to github.com as well as tickets and other things in process and lastly <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/877733" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#877733</a>. I had been searching for a calculator which can do currency calculations on the fly (say for e.g. doing personal budgeting for Taiwan debconf) without needing to manually enter the conversion rates and losing something in the middle. While the current version has support for some limited currencies, the new versions promise more as other people probably have more diverse needs for currency conversions (people who do long or short on oil, stocks overseas is just one example, I am sure there are many others) than simplistic mine. </p><br />Filed under: <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/category/miscellenous/">Miscellenous</a> Tagged: <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/american-education-system/">#American Education System</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/bug-filing/">#bug-filing</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/climate-change/">#Climate change</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/dignity/">#Dignity</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/e-commerce/">#e-commerce</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/gtk3/">#gtk+3</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/gtk2/">#gtk2</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/indian-economy-slowdown/">#Indian Economy 'Slowdown'</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/indian-education-system/">#Indian Education System</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/insolvency-and-bankruptcy-code/">#Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/las-vegas-shooting/">#Las Vegas shooting</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/modern-retail-in-india/">#Modern Retail in India</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/planet-debian/">#planet-debian</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/qalculate/">#qalculate</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/ad-hoc-and-adjunct-professors/">Ad-hoc and Adjunct Professors</a>, <a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/tag/wordpress-com/">wordpress.com</a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/flossexperiences.wordpress.com/4100/" /></a>

Dear all,

This would be a longish blog post (as most of mine are) compiled over days but
as there is so short a time and so much to share.

I had previously thought to share beautiful photographs of Ganesh mandals
taking out the procession at time of [immersion][1] of the idol or the last
day of [Durga Puja][2] recent events around do not make my mood to share
photos at this point in time. I may share some of them in a future blog post
or two .

   [1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesh_Chaturthi#In_public>
   [2]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja>

Before going further, I would like to offer my sympathies and condolences to
people hurt and dislocated in [Hurricane Irma][3] , the [2017 Central Mexico
Earthquake][4] and lastly the most recent [Las Vegas shooting][5] as well as
[Hurricane Maria][6] in Puerto Rico . I am somewhat nonplussed as to why
Americans always want to name, especially hurricanes which destroy people’s
lives and livelihood built over generations and why most of the hurricanes are
named after women. A look at weather.com [site][7] unveiled the answer to the
mystery.

   [3]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma>
   [4]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Central_Mexico_earthquake>
   [5]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_Strip_shooting>
   [6]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria>
   [7]: <https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/tropical-storm-hurricane-names-20130626#/!>

Ironically (or not) I saw some of the best science coverage about Earthquakes
or anything scientific reporting and analysis after a long time in mainstream
newspapers in India.

On another note, I don’t understand or even expect to understand why the
gunman did what he did 2 days back. Country music AFAIK is one of the most
chilled-out kind of music, in some ways very similar to classical Indian
singing although they are worlds apart in style of singing, renditions,
artists, the way they emote etc. I seriously wish that the gunman had not been
shot but caught and reasons were sought about what he did, he did. While this
is certainly armchair thinking as was not at the scene of crime, but if a
Mumbai Police constable could do it around a decade ago armed only with a
[lathi][8] could do it, why couldn’t the American cops who probably are
trained in innumerable ways to subdue people without killing them, did. While
investigations are on, I suspect if he were caught just like [Ajmal Kasab][9]
was caught then lot of revelations might have come up. From what is known, the
gentleman was upwardly mobile i.e. he was white, rich and apparently had no
reason to have beef with anybody especially a crowd swaying to some nice
music, all of which makes absolutely no sense.

**Indian Economy ‘Slowdown’**

Anyways, back to one of the main reasons of writing this blog post. Few days
back, an ex-finance Minister of India [Yashwant Sinha][10] wrote what was felt
by probably millions of Indians, an Indian Express article called ‘[I need to
speak up now][11]‘

   [10]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashwant_Sinha>
   [11]: <http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/yashwant-sinha-arun-jaitley-gst-demonetisation-narendra-modi-economy-bjp-i-need-to-speak-up-now-4862716/>

While there have been many, many arguments made since then by various people.
A simple search of ‘I need to speak up’ would lead to lead to many a result
besides the one I have shared above. The only exception I have with the
article is the line “Forty leading companies of the country are already facing
bankruptcy proceedings. Many more are likely to follow suit.” I would not bore
you but you ask any entrepreneur trying to set up shop in India i.e. ones who
actually go through the processes of getting all the licenses for setting up
even a small businesses as to the numerous hurdles they have to overcome and
laid-back corrupt bureaucracy which they have to overcome. I could have
interviewed some of my friends who had the conviction and the courage to set
up shop and spent more than half a decade getting all the necessary licenses
and approval to set up but it probably would be too specific for one industry
or the other and would lead to the same result.

Co-incidentally, a new restaurant, [leaf][12] opened in my vicinity few weeks
before. From the looks it looked like a high-brow, high-priced restaurant
hence like many others I did not venture in. After a few days, they introduced
south-Indian delicacies like [Masala Dosa][13], [Uttapam][14] at prices
similar to other restaurants around. So I ventured in and bought some south
Indian food to consume between mum and me.

   [12]: <https://www.zomato.com/pune/the-leaf-shivaji-nagar>
   [13]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_dosa>
   [14]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttapam>

Few days later, I became friends with the owner/franchisee and I suggested (in
a friendly tone) that why he doesn’t make it like a [CCD][15] play where many
people including yours truly use the service to share, strategize and meet
with clients.

   [15]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Coffee_Day>

The CCD joints usually serve coffee and snacks (which are over-priced but
still run out pretty fast) but people come as they have chilled-out atmosphere
and Wi-Fi access which people need for their smartphones, although the Wi-Fi
part may soon become redundant With [Reliance Jio][16] making a big play.

   [16]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jio>

I also shared why he doesn’t add more variety and time (the south Indian items
are time-limited) as I see/saw many empty chairs there.

Anyways, the shop-owner/franchisee shared his gross costs including salary,
stocking, electricity, rent and it doesn’t pan out to be serving Rs.80/- dish
(roughly a 1US dollar and 25 cents) then serving INR Rs. 400/- a dish (around
6 $USD). One round of INR 400/- + dishes make his costs for the day, around 12
tables were there. It’s when they have two full rounds of dishes costing INR
400/- or more that he actually has profits and he is predicting loss for at
least 6 months to a year before he makes a rebound. He needs steady customers
rather than just walk-ins that will make his business work/click. Currently
his family is bearing the costs. He didn’t mention the taxes although I know
apart from [GST][17] there are still some local body taxes that they will have
to pay and comply with.

   [17]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)>

There are a multitude of problems for shutting a shop legally as well as they
have to again renavigate the bureaucracy for the same. I have seen more than a
few retailers downing their shutters for 6-8 months and then either sell it to
new management, let go of the lease or simply sell the property to a
competitor. The [Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code][18] is probably the first
proper exit policy for large companies. So the 40 odd companies that Mr. Sinha
were talking about were probably sick for a long time.

   [18]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency_and_Bankruptcy_Code>

In India, there is also an additional shame of being a failed entrepreneur
unlike in the west where Entrepreneurs start on their next venture. As seen
from [Retailing In India][19] only 3.3% of the population or at the most 4% of
the population is directly or indirectly linked with the retail trade. Most of
the economy still derives its wealth from the agrarian sector which is still
reeling under the pressure from [demonetization][20] which happened last year.
Al jazeera surprisingly [portrayed][21] a truer picture of the effects
demonetization had on common citizen than many Indian newspapers did at the
time. Because of the South African Debconf, I had to resort to debit cards and
hence was able to escape standing in long lines in which many an old and women
perished.

It is only yesterday that the Government has acknowledged which many prominent
Indians have been saying for months now, that we are in a ‘[slowdown][22]‘. Be
aware of the terms being used for effect by the Prime Minister. There are
[two][23] [articles][24] which outlines the troubles India is in atm. The only
bright spot has been e-commerce which so far has eluded GST although the Govt.
has claimed regulations to put it in check.

**Indian Education System**

Interestingly, [Ravish Kumar][25] has started a series on [NDTV][26] where he
is showcasing how Indian education sector, especially public colleges have
been left to teachers on contract basis, see the first [four episodes][27] on
NDTV channel starting with the first one I have shared as a hyperlink. I
apologize as the series is in Hindi as the channel is meant for Indians and is
mostly limited to Northern areas of the Country (mostly) although he has been
honest that it is because they lack resources to tackle the amount of
information flowing to them. Ravish started the series with sharing
information about the U.S. where the things are similar with some
[teachers][28] needing to sleep in cars because of high-cost of living to some
needing to turn to [sex-work][29] . I was shocked when I read the guardian
article, that is no way to treat our teachers.I went on to read [‘How the
American University was Killed][30]‘ following the breadcrumbs along the way.
Reading that it seems Indians have been following the American system playbook
from the 1980’s itself. The article talks about HMO as well and that seems to
have followed here as well with my own experience of hospital fees and drugs
which I had to entail a few weeks/month ago.

Few years ago, when me and some of my friends had the teaching bug and we
started teaching in a nearby municipal school, couple of teachers had shared
that they were doing 2-3 jobs to make ends meet. I don’t know about others in
my group, at least I was cynical because I thought all the teachers were
permanent and they make good money only to realize now that the person was
probably speaking the truth. When you have to do three jobs to make ends meet
from where do you bring the passion to teach young people and that too outside
the syllabus ?

Also, with this new knowledge in hindsight, I take back all my comments I made
last year and the year before for the pathetic education being put up by the
State. With teachers being paid pathetically/underpaid and almost 60% teachers
being ad-hoc/adjunct teachers they have to find ways to have some sense of
security. Most teachers are bachelors as they are poor and cannot offer any
security (either male or female) and for women, after marriage it actually
makes no sense for them to continue in this profession. I salute all the
professors who are ad-hoc in nature and probably will never get a permanent
position in their life.

I think in some way, thanx to him, that the government has chosen to give [7th
pay commisson salary][31] to teachers. While the numbers may appear be large,
there are a lot of questions as to how many people will actually get paid.
There needs to be lot of vacancies which need to be filled quickly but don’t
see any solution in the next 2-3 years as well. The Government has taken a
position to use/re-hire retired teachers rather than have new young teachers
as an unwritten policy. In this [Digital India][32] context how are retired
teachers supposed to understand and then pass on digital concepts is beyond me
when at few teacher trainings I have seen they lack even the most basic
knowledge that I learnt at least a decade or two ago, the difference is that
vast. I just don’t know what to say to that. My own experience with my own
mother who had pretty good education in her time and probably would have made
a fine business-woman if she knew that she will have a child that she would
have to raise by herself alone (along with maternal grand-parents) is
testimonial to the fact how hard it is for older people to grasp technology
and here I’m talking just using the interface as a consumer rather than a
producer or someone in-between who has the idea of how companies and
governments profit from whatever data is shared one way or the other.

After watching the series/episodes and discussing the issue with my mother it
was revealed that both her and my late maternal grandfather were on casual/ad-
hoc basis till 20-25 years in their service in the defense sector. If Ravish
were to do a series on the defense sector he probably would find the same
thing there. To add to that, the defense sector is a vital component to a
country’s security. If 60% of the defense staff in all defense establishments
have temporary staff how do you ensure the loyalty of the people working
therein. That brings to my mind ‘Ignorance is bliss’.

**Software development and deployment**

There is another worry that all are skirting around, the present
dispensation/government’s mantra is ‘minimum government-maximum governance’
with digital technologies having all solutions which is leading to massive
unemployment. Also from most of the stories/incidents I read in the
newspapers, mainstream media and elsewhere it seems most software deployments
done in India are done without having any system of internal checks and
balances. There is no ‘[lintian][33]‘ for software to be implemented.
Contracts seem to be given to big companies and there is no mention of what
prerequisites or conditions were laid down by the Government for software
development and deployment and if any checks were done to ensure that the
software being developed was in according to government specifications or not.
Ideally this should all be in public domain so that questions can be asked and
responsibility fixed if things go haywire, as currently they do not.

**Software issue** s

As my health been not that great, I have been taking a bit more time and depth
while filing bugs. [#877638][34] is a good example. I suspect though that part
of the problem might be that mate has moved to gtk3 while guake still has
gtk-2 bindings. I also reported the issue upstream both in [mate-panel][35] as
well as [guake][35] . I haven’t received any response from either [ or/and
][35] upstreams .

   [34]: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=877638>
   [35]: <https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-panel/issues/666>

I also have been fiddling around with gdb to better understand the tool so I
can exploit/use this tool in a better way. There are some commands within the
gdb interface which seem to be interesting and hopefully I’ll try how the
commands perform over days, weeks to a month. I hope we see more action on the
mate-panel/guake bug as well as move of guake to gtk+3 but that what seemingly
seemed like wait for [eternity][36] seems to have [done][37] by somebody in
last couple of days. As shared in the ticket there are lots of things still to
do but it seems the heavy lifting has been done but seems merging will be
tricky as two developers have been trying to update to gtk+3 although
[aichingm ][38] seems to have a leg up with his [3!][39] branch.

Another interesting thing I saw is the below picture.

Firefox is out of date on wordpress.com

The firefox version I was using to test the site/wordpress-wp-admin was
Mozilla Firefox 52.4.0 which AFAIK is a pretty recentish one and people using
Debian stretch would probably be using the same version (firefox stable/LTS)
rather than the more recent versions. I went to the link it linked [to][40]
and it gave no indication as to why it thought my browser is out-of-date and
what functionality was/is missing. I have found that wordpress support has
declined quite a bit and people don’t seem to use the forums as much as they
used to before.

   [40]: <http://browsehappy.com/?locale=en>

I also filed a few bugs for qalculate. [#877716][41] where a supposedly
transitional package removes the actual application, [#877717][42] as the
software has moved its repo. to github.com as well as tickets and other things
in process and lastly [#877733][43]. I had been searching for a calculator
which can do currency calculations on the fly (say for e.g. doing personal
budgeting for Taiwan debconf) without needing to manually enter the conversion
rates and losing something in the middle. While the current version has
support for some limited currencies, the new versions promise more as other
people probably have more diverse needs for currency conversions (people who
do long or short on oil, stocks overseas is just one example, I am sure there
are many others) than simplistic mine.

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/nomeata.png" width="64" height="64" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>Often, when I mention how things work in the interactive theorem prover <a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/">Isabelle/HOL</a> to people with a strong background in functional programming (whether that means Haskell or Coq or something else), I cause confusion, especially around the issue of <em>what is a function</em>, are function <em>total</em> and what is the business with <em>undefined</em>. In this blog post, I want to explain some these issues, aimed at functional programmers or type theoreticians.</p>
<p>Note that this is not meant to be a tutorial; I will not explain how to do these things, and will focus on what they mean.</p>
<h3 id="hol-is-a-logic-of-total-functions">HOL is a logic of total functions</h3>
<p>If I have a Isabelle function <code>f :: a ⇒ b</code> between two types <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> (the function arrow in Isabelle is <code>⇒</code>, not <code>→</code>), then – by definition of what it means to be a function in HOL – whenever I have a value <code>x :: a</code>, then the expression <code>f x</code> (i.e. <code>f</code> applied to <code>x</code>) <em>is</em> a value of type <code>b</code>. Therefore, and without exception, <em>every Isabelle function is total</em>.</p>
<p>In particular, it cannot be that <code>f x</code> does not exist for some <code>x :: a</code>. This is a first difference from Haskell, which does have partial functions like</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">spin ::</span> <span class="dt">Maybe</span> <span class="dt">Integer</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Bool</span>
spin (<span class="dt">Just</span> n) <span class="fu">=</span> spin (<span class="dt">Just</span> (n<span class="fu">+</span><span class="dv">1</span>))</code></pre>
<p>Here, neither the expression <code>spin Nothing</code> nor the expression <code>spin (Just 42)</code> produce a value of type <code>Bool</code>: The former raises an exception (“incomplete pattern match”), the latter does not terminate. Confusingly, though, both expressions have type <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>Because every function is total, this confusion cannot arise in Isabelle: If an expression <code>e</code> has type <code>t</code>, then it <em>is</em> a value of type <code>t</code>. This trait is shared with other total systems, including Coq.</p>
<p>Did you notice the emphasis I put on the word “is” here, and how I deliberately did not write “evaluates to” or “returns”? This is because of another big source for confusion:</p>
<h3 id="isabelle-functions-do-not-compute">Isabelle functions do not compute</h3>
<p>We (i.e., functional programmers) stole the word “function” from mathematics and repurposed it<a class="footnoteRef" href="English_feed.rss.en#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. But the word “function”, in the context of Isabelle/HOL, refers to the mathematical concept of a function, and it helps to keep that in mind.</p>
<p>What is the difference?</p>
<ul>
<li>A function <code>a → b</code> in functional programming is an algorithm that, given a value of type <code>a</code>, calculates (returns, evaluates to) a value of type <code>b</code>.</li>
<li>A function <code>a ⇒ b</code> in math (or Isabelle/HOL) associates with each value of type <code>a</code> a value of type <code>b</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following is a perfectly valid function definition in math (and HOL), but could not be a function in the programming sense:</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>definition foo :: "(nat ⇒ real) ⇒ real" where
  "foo seq = (if convergent seq then lim seq else 0)"</code></pre>
<p>This assigns a real number to every sequence, but it does not <em>compute</em> it in any useful sense.</p>
<p>From this it follows that</p>
<h3 id="isabelle-functions-are-specified-not-defined">Isabelle functions are specified, not defined</h3>
<p>Consider this function definition:</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>fun plus :: "nat ⇒ nat ⇒ nat"  where
   "plus 0       m = m"
 | "plus (Suc n) m = Suc (plus n m)"</code></pre>
<p>To a functional programmer, this reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>plus</code> is a function that analyses its first argument. If that is <code>0</code>, then it returns the second argument. Otherwise, it calls itself with the predecessor of the first argument and increases the result by one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is clearly a description of a computation.</p>
<p>But to Isabelle/HOL, the above reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>plus</code> is a binary function on natural numbers, and it satisfies the following two equations: …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in fact, it is not so much Isabelle/HOL that reads it this way, but rather the <code>fun</code> command, which is external to the Isabelle/HOL logic. The <code>fun</code> command analyses the given equations, constructs a non-recursive definition of <code>plus</code> under the hood, passes <em>that</em> to Isabelle/HOL and then proves that the given equations hold for <code>plus</code>.</p>
<p>One interesting consequence of this is that different specifications can lead to the same functions. In fact, if we would define <code>plus'</code> by recursing on the second argument, we’d obtain the the same function (i.e. <code>plus = plus'</code> is a theorem, and there would be no way of telling the two apart).</p>
<h3 id="termination-is-a-property-of-specifications-not-functions">Termination is a property of specifications, not functions</h3>
<p>Because a function does not evaluate, it does not make sense to ask if it terminates. The question of termination arises <em>before</em> the function is defined: The <code>fun</code> command can only construct <code>plus</code> in a way that the equations hold if it can find a termination proof – very much like <code>Fixpoint</code> in Coq.</p>
<p>But while the termination check of <code>Fixpoint</code> in Coq is a deep part of the basic logic, in Isabelle it is simply something that this particular command requires. Other commands may have other means of defining a function that do not require a termination proof.</p>
<p>For example, a function specification that is tail-recursive can be turned in to a function, even without a termination proof: The following definition describes a higher-order function that iterates its first argument <code>f</code> on the second argument <code>x</code> until it finds a fixpoint. It is completely polymorphic (the single quote in <code>'a</code> indicates that this is a type variable):</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>partial_function (tailrec)
  fixpoint :: "('a ⇒ 'a) ⇒ 'a ⇒ 'a"
where
  "fixpoint f x = (if f x = x then x else fixpoint f (f x))"</code></pre>
<p>We can work with this definition just fine. For example, if we instantiate <code>f</code> with <code>(λx. x-1)</code>, we can prove that it will always return 0:</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>lemma "fixpoint (λ n . n - 1) (n::nat) = 0"
  by (induction n) (auto simp add: fixpoint.simps)</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, if we have a function that works within the option monad (i.e. |Maybe| in Haskell), its specification can always be turned into a function without an explicit termination proof – here one that calculates the Collatz sequence:</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>partial_function (option) collatz :: "nat ⇒ nat list option"
 where "collatz n =
        (if n = 1 then Some [n]
         else if even n
           then do { ns &lt;- collatz (n div 2);    Some (n # ns) }
           else do { ns &lt;- collatz (3 * n + 1);  Some (n # ns)})"</code></pre>
<p>Note that lists in Isabelle are finite (like in Coq, unlike in Haskell), so this function “returns” a list only if the collatz sequence eventually reaches 1.</p>
<p>I expect these definitions to make a Coq user very uneasy. How can <code>fixpoint</code> be a total function? What is <code>fixpoint (λn. n+1)</code>? What if we run <code>collatz n</code> for a <code>n</code> where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz sequence</a> does <em>not</em> reach 1?<a class="footnoteRef" href="English_feed.rss.en#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> We will come back to that question after a little detour…</p>
<h3 id="hol-is-a-logic-of-non-empty-types">HOL is a logic of non-empty types</h3>
<p>Another big difference between Isabelle and Coq is that in Isabelle/HOL, <em>every type is inhabited</em>. Just like the totality of functions, this is a very fundamental fact about what HOL defines to be a type.</p>
<p>Isabelle gets away with that design because in Isabelle, we do not use types for propositions (like we do in Coq), so we do not need empty types to denote false propositions.</p>
<p>This design has an important consequence: It allows the existence of a polymorphic expression that inhabits any type, namely</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>undefined :: 'a</code></pre>
<p>The naming of this term alone has caused a great deal of confusion for Isabelle beginners, or in communication with users of different systems, so I implore you to not read too much into the name. In fact, you will have a better time if you think of it as <code>arbitrary</code> or, even better, <code>unknown</code>.</p>
<p>Since <code>undefined</code> can be instantiated at any type, we can instantiate it for example at <code>bool</code>, and we can observe an important fact: <code>undefined</code> is not an <em>extra</em> value besides the “usual ones”. It is simply <em>some</em> value of that type, which is demonstrated in the following lemma:</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>lemma "undefined = True ∨ undefined = False" by auto</code></pre>
<p>In fact, if the type has only one value (such as the unit type), then we know the value of <code>undefined</code> for sure:</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>lemma "undefined = ()" by auto</code></pre>
<p>It is very handy to be able to produce an expression of any type, as we will see as follows</p>
<h3 id="partial-functions-are-just-underspecified-functions">Partial functions are just underspecified functions</h3>
<p>For example, it allows us to translate incomplete function specifications. Consider this definition, Isabelle’s equivalent of Haskell’s partial <code>fromJust</code> function:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">fun fromSome :: <span class="st">"'a option ⇒ 'a"</span> <span class="kw">where</span>
  <span class="st">"fromSome (Some x) = x"</span></code></pre>
<p>This definition is accepted by <code>fun</code> (albeit with a warning), and the generated function <code>fromSome</code> behaves exactly as specified: when applied to <code>Some x</code>, it is <code>x</code>. The term <code>fromSome None</code> is also a value of type <code>'a</code>, we just do not know which one it is, as the specification does not address that.</p>
<p>So <code>fromSome None</code> behaves just like <code>undefined</code> above, i.e. we can prove</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>lemma "fromSome None = False ∨ fromSome None = True" by auto</code></pre>
<p>Here is a small exercise for you: Can you come up with an explanation for the following lemma:</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>fun constOrId :: "bool ⇒ bool" where
  "constOrId True = True"

lemma "constOrId = (λ_.True) ∨ constOrId = (λx. x)"
  by (metis (full_types) constOrId.simps)</code></pre>
<p>Overall, this behavior makes sense if we remember that function “definitions” in Isabelle/HOL are not really definitions, but rather specifications. And a partial function “definition” is simply a underspecification. The resulting function is simply any function hat fulfills the specification, and the two lemmas above underline that observation.</p>
<h3 id="nonterminating-functions-are-also-just-underspecified">Nonterminating functions are also just underspecified</h3>
<p>Let us return to the puzzle posed by <code>fixpoint</code> above. Clearly, the function – seen as a functional program – is not total: When passed the argument <code>(λn. n + 1)</code> or <code>(λb. ¬b)</code> it will loop forever trying to find a fixed point.</p>
<p>But Isabelle functions are not functional programs, and the definitions are just specifications. What does the specification say about the case when <code>f</code> has no fixed-point? It states that the equation <code>fixpoint f x = fixpoint f (f x)</code> holds. And this equation has a solution, for example <code>fixpoint f _ = undefined</code>.</p>
<p>Or more concretely: The specification of the <code>fixpoint</code> function states that <code>fixpoint (λb. ¬b) True = fixpoint (λb. ¬b) False</code> has to hold, but it does not specify which particular value (<code>True</code> or <code>False</code>) it should denote – any is fine.</p>
<h3 id="not-all-function-specifications-are-ok">Not all function specifications are ok</h3>
<p>At this point you might wonder: Can I just specify any equations for a function <code>f</code> and get a function out of that? But rest assured: That is not the case. For example, no Isabelle command allows you define a function <code>bogus :: () ⇒ nat</code> with the equation <code>bogus () = S (bogus ())</code>, because this equation does not have a solution.</p>
<p>We can actually prove that such a function cannot exist:</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>lemma no_bogus: "∄ bogus. bogus () = Suc (bogus ())" by simp</code></pre>
<p>(Of course, <code>not_bogus () = not_bogus ()</code> is just fine…)</p>
<h3 id="you-cannot-reason-about-partiality-in-isabelle">You cannot reason about partiality in Isabelle</h3>
<p>We have seen that there are many ways to define functions that one might consider “partial”. Given a function, can we prove that it is not “partial” in that sense?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, but unavoidably, no: Since <code>undefined</code> is not a separate, recognizable value, but rather simply an unknown one, there is no way of stating that “A function result is not specified”.</p>
<p>Here is an example that demonstrates this: Two “partial” functions (one with not all cases specified, the other one with a self-referential specification) are indistinguishable from the total variant:</p>
<pre class="isabelle"><code>fun partial1 :: "bool ⇒ unit" where
  "partial1 True = ()"
partial_function (tailrec) partial2 :: "bool ⇒ unit" where
  "partial2 b = partial2 b"
fun total :: "bool ⇒ unit" where
  "total True = ()"
| "total False = ()"

lemma "partial1 = total ∧ partial2 = total" by auto</code></pre>
<p>If you really <em>do</em> want to reason about partiality of functional programs in Isabelle, you should consider implementing them not as plain HOL functions, but rather use <a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/HOLCF/README.html">HOLCF</a>, where you can give equational specifications of functional programs and obtain <em>continuous functions</em> between <em>domains</em>. In that setting, <code>⊥ ≠ ()</code> and <code>partial2 = ⊥ ≠ total</code>. We have done that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1340">to verify some of HLint’s equations</a>.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-still-compute-with-isabelle-functions">You can still compute with Isabelle functions</h3>
<p>I hope by this point, I have not scared away anyone who wants to use Isabelle for functional programming, and in fact, you can use it for that. If the equations that you pass to `fun are a reasonable definition for a function (in the programming sense), then these equations, used as rewriting rules, will allow you to “compute” that function quite like you would in Coq or Haskell.</p>
<p>Moreover, Isabelle supports code extraction: You can take the equations of your Isabelle functions and have them expored into Ocaml, Haskell, Scala or Standard ML.

<p>While these usually are the equations you defined the function with, they don't have to: You can declare other proved equations to be used for code extraction, e.g. to refine your elegant definitions to performant ones.</p>
<p>Like with code extraction from Coq to, say, Haskell, the adequacy of the translations rests on a <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/publications/danielsson-et-al-popl2006.html">“moral reasoning” foundation</a>. Unlike extraction from Coq, where you have an (unformalized) guarantee that the resulting Haskell code is terminating, you do not get that guarantee from Isabelle. Conversely, this allows you do reason about and extract non-terminating programs, like <code>fixpoint</code>, which is not possible in Coq.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://www21.in.tum.de/~hupel/pub/isabelle-cakeml.pdf">currently ongoing work</a> about verified code generation, where the code equations are reflected into a deep embedding of HOL in Isabelle/HOL that would allow explicit termination proofs.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>We have seen how in Isabelle/HOL, <em>every function is total</em>. Function declarations have equations, but these do not <em>define</em> the function in an computational sense, but rather <em>specify</em> them. Because in HOL, there are no empty types, many specifications that appear partial (incomplete patterns, non-terminating recursion) have solutions in the space of total functions. Partiality in the specification is no longer visible in the final product.</p>
<h3 id="ps-axiom-undefined-in-coq">PS: Axiom <code>undefined</code> in Coq</h3>
<p><em>This section is speculative, and an invitation for discussion.</em></p>
<p>Coq already distinguishes between types used in programs (<code>Set</code>) and types used in proofs <code>Prop</code>.</p>
<p>Could Coq ensure that every <code>t : Set</code> is non-empty? I imagine this would require additional checks in the <code>Inductive</code> command, similar to the checks that the Isabelle command <code>datatype</code> has to perform<a class="footnoteRef" href="English_feed.rss.en#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and it would disallow <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Init.Datatypes.html"><code>Empty_set</code></a>.</p>
<p>If so, then it would be sound to add the following axiom</p>
<pre class="coq"><code>Axiom undefined : forall (a : Set), a.</code></pre>
<p>wouldn't it? This axiom does not have any computational meaning, but that seems to be ok for optional Coq axioms, like classical reasoning or function extensionality.</p>
<p>With this in place, how much of what I describe above about function definitions in Isabelle could now be done soundly in Coq. Certainly pattern matches would not have to be complete and could sport an implicit case <code>_ ⇒ undefined</code>. Would it “help” with non-obviously terminating functions? Would it allow a Coq command <code>Tailrecursive</code> that accepts any tailrecursive function without a termination check?</p>

http://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/732-Isabelle_functions__Always_total%2C_sometimes_undefined

Often, when I mention how things work in the interactive theorem prover
[Isabelle/HOL][1] to people with a strong background in functional programming
(whether that means Haskell or Coq or something else), I cause confusion,
especially around the issue of _what is a function_ , are function _total_ and
what is the business with _undefined_. In this blog post, I want to explain
some these issues, aimed at functional programmers or type theoreticians.

   [1]: <http://isabelle.in.tum.de/>

Note that this is not meant to be a tutorial; I will not explain how to do
these things, and will focus on what they mean.

### HOL is a logic of total functions

If I have a Isabelle function `f :: a ⇒ b` between two types `a` and `b` (the
function arrow in Isabelle is `⇒`, not `→`), then – by definition of what it
means to be a function in HOL – whenever I have a value `x :: a`, then the
expression `f x` (i.e. `f` applied to `x`) _is_ a value of type `b`.
Therefore, and without exception, _every Isabelle function is total_.

In particular, it cannot be that `f x` does not exist for some `x :: a`. This
is a first difference from Haskell, which does have partial functions like

    
    
    spin :: Maybe Integer -> Bool
    spin (Just n) = spin (Just (n+1))

Here, neither the expression `spin Nothing` nor the expression `spin (Just
42)` produce a value of type `Bool`: The former raises an exception
(“incomplete pattern match”), the latter does not terminate. Confusingly,
though, both expressions have type `Bool`.

Because every function is total, this confusion cannot arise in Isabelle: If
an expression `e` has type `t`, then it _is_ a value of type `t`. This trait
is shared with other total systems, including Coq.

Did you notice the emphasis I put on the word “is” here, and how I
deliberately did not write “evaluates to” or “returns”? This is because of
another big source for confusion:

### Isabelle functions do not compute

We (i.e., functional programmers) stole the word “function” from mathematics
and repurposed it[1][2]. But the word “function”, in the context of
Isabelle/HOL, refers to the mathematical concept of a function, and it helps
to keep that in mind.

   [2]: <English_feed.rss.en#fn1>

What is the difference?

  * A function `a → b` in functional programming is an algorithm that, given a value of type `a`, calculates (returns, evaluates to) a value of type `b`.
  * A function `a ⇒ b` in math (or Isabelle/HOL) associates with each value of type `a` a value of type `b`.

For example, the following is a perfectly valid function definition in math
(and HOL), but could not be a function in the programming sense:

    
    
    definition foo :: "(nat ⇒ real) ⇒ real" where
      "foo seq = (if convergent seq then lim seq else 0)"

This assigns a real number to every sequence, but it does not _compute_ it in
any useful sense.

>From this it follows that

### Isabelle functions are specified, not defined

Consider this function definition:

    
    
    fun plus :: "nat ⇒ nat ⇒ nat"  where
       "plus 0       m = m"
     | "plus (Suc n) m = Suc (plus n m)"

To a functional programmer, this reads

> `plus` is a function that analyses its first argument. If that is `0`, then
it returns the second argument. Otherwise, it calls itself with the
predecessor of the first argument and increases the result by one.

which is clearly a description of a computation.

But to Isabelle/HOL, the above reads

> `plus` is a binary function on natural numbers, and it satisfies the
following two equations: …

And in fact, it is not so much Isabelle/HOL that reads it this way, but rather
the `fun` command, which is external to the Isabelle/HOL logic. The `fun`
command analyses the given equations, constructs a non-recursive definition of
`plus` under the hood, passes _that_ to Isabelle/HOL and then proves that the
given equations hold for `plus`.

One interesting consequence of this is that different specifications can lead
to the same functions. In fact, if we would define `plus'` by recursing on the
second argument, we’d obtain the the same function (i.e. `plus = plus'` is a
theorem, and there would be no way of telling the two apart).

### Termination is a property of specifications, not functions

Because a function does not evaluate, it does not make sense to ask if it
terminates. The question of termination arises _before_ the function is
defined: The `fun` command can only construct `plus` in a way that the
equations hold if it can find a termination proof – very much like `Fixpoint`
in Coq.

But while the termination check of `Fixpoint` in Coq is a deep part of the
basic logic, in Isabelle it is simply something that this particular command
requires. Other commands may have other means of defining a function that do
not require a termination proof.

For example, a function specification that is tail-recursive can be turned in
to a function, even without a termination proof: The following definition
describes a higher-order function that iterates its first argument `f` on the
second argument `x` until it finds a fixpoint. It is completely polymorphic
(the single quote in `'a` indicates that this is a type variable):

    
    
    partial_function (tailrec)
      fixpoint :: "('a ⇒ 'a) ⇒ 'a ⇒ 'a"
    where
      "fixpoint f x = (if f x = x then x else fixpoint f (f x))"

We can work with this definition just fine. For example, if we instantiate `f`
with `(λx. x-1)`, we can prove that it will always return 0:

    
    
    lemma "fixpoint (λ n . n - 1) (n::nat) = 0"
      by (induction n) (auto simp add: fixpoint.simps)

Similarly, if we have a function that works within the option monad (i.e.
|Maybe| in Haskell), its specification can always be turned into a function
without an explicit termination proof – here one that calculates the Collatz
sequence:

    
    
    partial_function (option) collatz :: "nat ⇒ nat list option"
     where "collatz n =
            (if n = 1 then Some [n]
             else if even n
               then do { ns <- collatz (n div 2);    Some (n # ns) }
               else do { ns <- collatz (3 * n + 1);  Some (n # ns)})"

Note that lists in Isabelle are finite (like in Coq, unlike in Haskell), so
this function “returns” a list only if the collatz sequence eventually reaches
1.

I expect these definitions to make a Coq user very uneasy. How can `fixpoint`
be a total function? What is `fixpoint (λn. n+1)`? What if we run `collatz n`
for a `n` where the [Collatz sequence][3] does _not_ reach 1?[ 2][4] We will
come back to that question after a little detour…

   [3]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture>
   [4]: <English_feed.rss.en#fn2>

### HOL is a logic of non-empty types

Another big difference between Isabelle and Coq is that in Isabelle/HOL,
_every type is inhabited_. Just like the totality of functions, this is a very
fundamental fact about what HOL defines to be a type.

Isabelle gets away with that design because in Isabelle, we do not use types
for propositions (like we do in Coq), so we do not need empty types to denote
false propositions.

This design has an important consequence: It allows the existence of a
polymorphic expression that inhabits any type, namely

    
    
    undefined :: 'a

The naming of this term alone has caused a great deal of confusion for
Isabelle beginners, or in communication with users of different systems, so I
implore you to not read too much into the name. In fact, you will have a
better time if you think of it as `arbitrary` or, even better, `unknown`.

Since `undefined` can be instantiated at any type, we can instantiate it for
example at `bool`, and we can observe an important fact: `undefined` is not an
_extra_ value besides the “usual ones”. It is simply _some_ value of that
type, which is demonstrated in the following lemma:

    
    
    lemma "undefined = True ∨ undefined = False" by auto

In fact, if the type has only one value (such as the unit type), then we know
the value of `undefined` for sure:

    
    
    lemma "undefined = ()" by auto

It is very handy to be able to produce an expression of any type, as we will
see as follows

### Partial functions are just underspecified functions

For example, it allows us to translate incomplete function specifications.
Consider this definition, Isabelle’s equivalent of Haskell’s partial
`fromJust` function:

    
    
    fun fromSome :: "'a option ⇒ 'a" where
      "fromSome (Some x) = x"

This definition is accepted by `fun` (albeit with a warning), and the
generated function `fromSome` behaves exactly as specified: when applied to
`Some x`, it is `x`. The term `fromSome None` is also a value of type `'a`, we
just do not know which one it is, as the specification does not address that.

So `fromSome None` behaves just like `undefined` above, i.e. we can prove

    
    
    lemma "fromSome None = False ∨ fromSome None = True" by auto

Here is a small exercise for you: Can you come up with an explanation for the
following lemma:

    
    
    fun constOrId :: "bool ⇒ bool" where
      "constOrId True = True"
    
    lemma "constOrId = (λ_.True) ∨ constOrId = (λx. x)"
      by (metis (full_types) constOrId.simps)

Overall, this behavior makes sense if we remember that function “definitions”
in Isabelle/HOL are not really definitions, but rather specifications. And a
partial function “definition” is simply a underspecification. The resulting
function is simply any function hat fulfills the specification, and the two
lemmas above underline that observation.

### Nonterminating functions are also just underspecified

Let us return to the puzzle posed by `fixpoint` above. Clearly, the function –
seen as a functional program – is not total: When passed the argument `(λn. n
+ 1)` or `(λb. ¬b)` it will loop forever trying to find a fixed point.

But Isabelle functions are not functional programs, and the definitions are
just specifications. What does the specification say about the case when `f`
has no fixed-point? It states that the equation `fixpoint f x = fixpoint f (f
x)` holds. And this equation has a solution, for example `fixpoint f _ =
undefined`.

Or more concretely: The specification of the `fixpoint` function states that
`fixpoint (λb. ¬b) True = fixpoint (λb. ¬b) False` has to hold, but it does
not specify which particular value (`True` or `False`) it should denote – any
is fine.

### Not all function specifications are ok

At this point you might wonder: Can I just specify any equations for a
function `f` and get a function out of that? But rest assured: That is not the
case. For example, no Isabelle command allows you define a function `bogus ::
() ⇒ nat` with the equation `bogus () = S (bogus ())`, because this equation
does not have a solution.

We can actually prove that such a function cannot exist:

    
    
    lemma no_bogus: "∄ bogus. bogus () = Suc (bogus ())" by simp

(Of course, `not_bogus () = not_bogus ()` is just fine…)

### You cannot reason about partiality in Isabelle

We have seen that there are many ways to define functions that one might
consider “partial”. Given a function, can we prove that it is not “partial” in
that sense?

Unfortunately, but unavoidably, no: Since `undefined` is not a separate,
recognizable value, but rather simply an unknown one, there is no way of
stating that “A function result is not specified”.

Here is an example that demonstrates this: Two “partial” functions (one with
not all cases specified, the other one with a self-referential specification)
are indistinguishable from the total variant:

    
    
    fun partial1 :: "bool ⇒ unit" where
      "partial1 True = ()"
    partial_function (tailrec) partial2 :: "bool ⇒ unit" where
      "partial2 b = partial2 b"
    fun total :: "bool ⇒ unit" where
      "total True = ()"
    | "total False = ()"
    
    lemma "partial1 = total ∧ partial2 = total" by auto

If you really _do_ want to reason about partiality of functional programs in
Isabelle, you should consider implementing them not as plain HOL functions,
but rather use [HOLCF][5], where you can give equational specifications of
functional programs and obtain _continuous functions_ between _domains_. In
that setting, `⊥ ≠ ()` and `partial2 = ⊥ ≠ total`. We have done that [to
verify some of HLint’s equations][6].

   [5]: <http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/HOLCF/README.html>
   [6]: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1340>

### You can still compute with Isabelle functions

I hope by this point, I have not scared away anyone who wants to use Isabelle
for functional programming, and in fact, you can use it for that. If the
equations that you pass to `fun are a reasonable definition for a function (in
the programming sense), then these equations, used as rewriting rules, will
allow you to “compute” that function quite like you would in Coq or Haskell.

Moreover, Isabelle supports code extraction: You can take the equations of
your Isabelle functions and have them expored into Ocaml, Haskell, Scala or
Standard ML. See [Concon][7] for a conference management system with
confidentially verified in Isabelle.

   [7]: <http://www21.in.tum.de/~popescua/rs3/CoCon.html>

While these usually are the equations you defined the function with, they
don't have to: You can declare other proved equations to be used for code
extraction, e.g. to refine your elegant definitions to performant ones.

Like with code extraction from Coq to, say, Haskell, the adequacy of the
translations rests on a [“moral reasoning” foundation][8]. Unlike extraction
from Coq, where you have an (unformalized) guarantee that the resulting
Haskell code is terminating, you do not get that guarantee from Isabelle.
Conversely, this allows you do reason about and extract non-terminating
programs, like `fixpoint`, which is not possible in Coq.

   [8]: <http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/publications/danielsson-et-al-popl2006.html>

There is [currently ongoing work][9] about verified code generation, where the
code equations are reflected into a deep embedding of HOL in Isabelle/HOL that
would allow explicit termination proofs.

   [9]: <https://www21.in.tum.de/~hupel/pub/isabelle-cakeml.pdf>

### Conclusion

We have seen how in Isabelle/HOL, _every function is total_. Function
declarations have equations, but these do not _define_ the function in an
computational sense, but rather _specify_ them. Because in HOL, there are no
empty types, many specifications that appear partial (incomplete patterns,
non-terminating recursion) have solutions in the space of total functions.
Partiality in the specification is no longer visible in the final product.

### PS: Axiom `undefined` in Coq

_This section is speculative, and an invitation for discussion._

Coq already distinguishes between types used in programs (`Set`) and types
used in proofs `Prop`.

Could Coq ensure that every `t : Set` is non-empty? I imagine this would
require additional checks in the `Inductive` command, similar to the checks
that the Isabelle command `datatype` has to perform[3][10], and it would
disallow [`Empty_set`][11].

   [10]: <English_feed.rss.en#fn3>
   [11]: <https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Init.Datatypes.html>

If so, then it would be sound to add the following axiom

    
    
    Axiom undefined : forall (a : Set), a.

wouldn't it? This axiom does not have any computational meaning, but that
seems to be ok for optional Coq axioms, like classical reasoning or function
extensionality.

With this in place, how much of what I describe above about function
definitions in Isabelle could now be done soundly in Coq. Certainly pattern
matches would not have to be complete and could sport an implicit case `_ ⇒
undefined`. Would it “help” with non-obviously terminating functions? Would it
allow a Coq command `Tailrecursive` that accepts any tailrecursive function
without a termination check?

armadillo image

We are thrilled to announce a new _big_ [RcppArmadillo][1] release! Conrad
recently moved [Armadillo][2] to the 8.* series, with significant improvements
and speed ups for sparse matrix operations, and more. See below for a brief
summary.

   [1]: <http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html>
   [2]: <http://arma.sourceforge.net/>

This also required some changes at our end which [Binxiang Ni][3] provided,
and [Serguei Sokol][4] improved some instantiations. We now show the new
vignette [Binxiang Ni][3] wrote for his GSoC contribution, and I converted it
(and the other main vignette) to using the [pinp][5] package for sleeker pdf
vignettes.

   [3]: <https://github.com/binxiangni>
   [4]: <https://github.com/sgsokol>
   [5]: <http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/pinp.html>

This release resumes our bi-monthly CRAN release cycle. I may make interim
updates available at GitHub "as needed". And this time I managed to mess up
the reverse depends testing, and missed one `sync()` call on the way back to R
---but all that is now taken care of.

[Armadillo][6] is a powerful and expressive C++ template library for linear
algebra aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use with a
syntax deliberately close to a Matlab. [RcppArmadillo][7] integrates this
library with the [R][8] environment and language--and is widely used by
(currently) 405 other packages on [CRAN][9].

   [9]: <https://cran.r-project.org>

A high-level summary of changes follows.

> #### Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.8.100.1.0 (2017-10-05)

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/skx.png" width="76" height="105" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>It feels like the past week or two has been very busy, and so I'm looking forward to my "holiday" next month.</p>

<p>I'm not really having a holiday of course, my wife is slowly returning to work, so I'll be taking a month of paternity leave, taking
sole care of Oiva for the month of November.  He's still a little angel, and now that he's reached 10 months old he's starting to
get much more mobile - he's on the verge of walking, but not quite there yet.  Mostly that means he wants you to hold his hands so
that he can stand up, swaying back and forth before the inevitable collapse.</p>

<p>Beyond spending most of my evenings taking care of him, from the moment I return from work to his bedtime (around 7:30PM), I've
made the <a href="https://debian-administration.org/">Debian Administration</a> website both read-only and much simpler.  In the past that
site was powered by a lot of servers, I think around 11.  Now it has only a small number of machines, which should slowly decrease.</p>

<p>I've ripped out the database host, the redis host, the events-server, the planet-machine, the email-box, etc.  Now we have a much
simpler setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>Front-end machine
<ul>
<li>Directly serves <a href="https://code.debian-administration.org/">the code site</a></li>
<li>Directly serves <a href="https://ssl.debian-administration.org/">the SSL site</a> which exists solely for Let's Encrypt</li>
<li>Runs HAProxy to route the rest of the requests to the cluster.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>4 x Apache servers
<ul>
<li>Each one has a (read-only) MySQL database on it for the content.
<ul>
<li>In case of future-compromise I removed all user passwords, and scrambled the email-addresses.</li>
<li>I don't think there's a huge risk, but better safe than sorry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each one runs the web-application.
<ul>
<li>Which now caches each generated page to /tmp/x/x/x/x/$hash if it doesn't exist.</li>
<li>If the request is cached it is served from that cache rather than dynamically.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally although I'm slowly making progress with "radio stuff" I've knocked up a simple hack which uses an ultrasonic sensor
to determine whether I'm sat in front of my (home) PC.  If I am everything is good.  If I'm absent the music is stopped and
the screen locked.  Kinda neat.</p>

<p>(Simple ESP8266 device wired to the sensor.  When the state changes a message is posted to Mosquitto, where a listener reacts
to the change(s).)</p>

<p>Oh, not final.  I've also transfered my mobile phone from DNA.fi to MoiMobile.  Which should complete soon, right now my phone is in limbo, active on niether service.  Oops.</p>

<p>During a long era, electronic mail was the main communication tool for enterprises. <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, which offer public or private group discussion boards and instant messaging between two people, challenge its position, especially in the IT industry.</p>

https://carlchenet.com/the-slack-threat/

During a long era, electronic mail was the main communication tool for
enterprises. [Slack][1], which offer public or private group discussion boards
and instant messaging between two people, challenge its position, especially
in the IT industry.

   [1]: <https://slack.com/>

Not only Slack has features known and used since [IRC launch][2] in the late
’80s, but Slack also offers file sending and sharing, code quoting, and it
indexing for ulterior searches everything that goes through the application.
Slack is also modular with numerous plug-in to easily add new features.

   [2]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>

[][3]

   [3]: <https://slack.com>

Using the Software-As-A-Service (SAAS) model, Slack basic version is free, and
users pay for options. Slack is now considered by the Github generation like
the new main enterprise communication tool.

As I did in my previous article on [the Github threat][4], this one won’t
promote Slask’s advantages, as many other articles have already covered all
these points ad nauseam, but to show the other side and to warn the companies
using this service about its inherent risks. So far, these risks have been
ignored, sometimes voluntary in the name of the “It works™” ideology.
Neglecting all economic and safety consideration, neglecting all threat to
privacy and individual freedom. We’ll see about them below.

   [4]: <https://carlchenet.com/the-github-threat/>

[][5]

   [5]: <https://github.com>

Github, a software forge as a SAAS, with all the advantage but also all the
risk of its economic model

**All your company communication since its creation**

When a start-up chooses Slack, all of its internal communication will be
stored by Slack. When someone uses this service, the simple fact to chat
through it means that the whole communication is archived.

One may point that within the basic Slack offer, only the last 10.000 messages
can be read and searched. Bad argument. Slack stored every message and every
file shared as it pleases. We’ll see below this application behavior is of
capital importance in the Slack threat to enterprises.

And the problem is the same for all other companies which choose Slack at one
point or another. If they replace their traditional communication method with
it, Slack will have access to capital data, not only in volume, but also
because of their value for the company itself… Or anyone interested in this
company life.

**Search Your Entire Archive**

One of the main arguments to use Slack is its “Search your entire archive”
feature. One can search almost anything one can think of. Why? Because
everything is indexed. Your team chat archive or the more or less confidential
documents exchanged with the accountant department; everything is in it in
order to provide the most effective search tool.

The search bar, well-known by Slack users

We can’t deny it’s a very attractive feature for everyone inside the company.
But it is also a very attractive feature for everyone outside of the company
who would want to know more about its internal life. Even more if you’re
looking for a specific subject.

If Slack is the main communication tool of your company, and if as I’ve
experienced in my professional life, some teams prefer to use it than to go to
the office next door or even bug you to put the information on the dedicated
channel, one can easily deduce that nothing—in this type of company—escape
Slack. The automatic indexation and the search feature efficiency are
excellent tools to get all the information needed, in quantity and in quality.

As such, it’s a great social engineering tool for everyone who has access to
it, with a history as old as the use of Slack as a communication tool in the
company.

**Across borders… And Beyond!**

Slack is a Web service which uses mainly [Amazon Web services][6] and most
specially [Cloudfront][7], as stated by the available information on Slack
infrastructure.

   [6]: <https://aws.amazon.com/fr/>
   [7]: <https://aws.amazon.com/fr/cloudfront/>

Even without a complete study of said infrastructure, it’s easy to state that
all the data regarding many innovative global companies around the world (and
some of them including for all their internal communication since their
creation) are located in the United States, or at least in the hands of a US
company, which must follow US laws, a country with a well-known history of
large scale industrial espionage, as the whistleblower [Edward Snowden][8]
demonstrated it in 2013 and where company data access has no restriction under
[the Patriot Act][9], as in the Microsoft case (2014) where data stored in
Ireland by the Redmond software editor have been given to US authorities.

   [8]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden>
   [9]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act>

Edward Snowden, an individual—and corporate—freedom fighter

As such, Slack’s automatic indexation and search tool are a boon for
anyone—spy agency or hacker—which get authorized access to it.

To trust a third party with all, or at least most of, your internal corporate
communication is a certain risk for your company if the said third party
doesn’t follow the same regulations as yours or if it has different interests,
from a data security point of view or more globally on its competitiveness. A
badly timed data leak can be catastrophic.

What’s the point of secretly preparing a new product launch or an aggressive
takeover if all your recent Slack conversations have leaked, including your
secret plans?

**What if… Slack is hacked?**

First let’s remember that even if a cyber attack may appear as a rare or
hypothetical scenario to a badly informed and hurried manager, it is far from
being as rare as she or he believes it (or wants to believe it).

Infrastructure hacking is quite common, as a regular visit to [Hacker
News][10] will give you multiple evidence. And Slack itself has already been
hacked.

February 2015: Slack is the victim during four days of a cyber attack, which
was made public by the company in March. Officially, the unauthorized access
was limited to information on the users’ profiles. It is impossible to measure
exactly what and who was impacted by this attack. In a recent announcement,
Yahoo confessed that these 3 billion accounts (you’ve read well: 3 billions)
were compromised … late 2014!

[][11]

   [11]: <https://yahoo.com>

Yahoo, the company which suffered the largest recorded cyberattack regarding
the compromised account numbers

Officially, Slack stated that “No financial or payment information was
accessed or compromised in this attack.” Which is, and by far, the least
interesting of all data stored within Slack! With company internal
communication indexed—sometimes from the very beginning of said company—and
searchable, Slack may be a potential target for cybercriminal not looking for

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/corsac-planet.png" width="80" height="81" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>A <a href="https://www.corsac.net/../index.php?rub=blog&amp;post=1548">long time
ago</a>, I switched my GnuPG setup to a smartcard based one. I kept
using the same master key, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>copied the rsa4096 master key to a “master” smartcard, for
when I need to sign (certify) other keys;</li>
<li>created rsa2048 subkeys (for signature, encryption and
authentication) and moved them to an OpenPGP smartcard for daily
usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been working with that setup for a few years now and it is
working perfectly fine. The signature counter on the OpenPGP basic
card is a bit north of 5000 which is large but not that huge, all
considered (and not counting authentication and decryption key
usage).<br />
<br />
One very nice feature of using a smartcard is that my laptop (or
other machines I work on) never manipulates the private key
directly but only sends request to the card, which is a really huge
improvement, in my opinion. But it's also not the perfect solution
for me: the <a href="https://g10code.com/p-card.html">OpenPGP
card</a> uses a proprietary platform from <a href="http://www.zeitcontrol.de/en">ZeitControl</a>, named <a href="http://basiccard.com/">BasicCard</a>. We have very few information
on the smartcard, besides the fact that Werner Koch trust
ZeistControl to not mess up. One caveat for me is that the card
does not use a certified secure microcontroler like you would find
in smartcard chips found in debit card or electronic IDs. That
means it's not really been audited by a competent hardware lab, and
thus can't be considered secure against physical attacks. The
cardOS software and the application implementing the OpenPGP
specification are not public either and have not been audited
either, to the best of my knowledge.<br />
<br />
At one point I was interested in the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey-neo/">Yubikey
Neo</a>, especially since the architecture Yubico used was common:
a (supposedly) certified platform (secure microcontroler, card OS)
and a GlobalPlatform / JavaCard virtual machine. The applet used in
the Yubikey Neo is <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/ykneo-openpgp">open-source</a>, too, so
you could take a look at it and identify any issue.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Yubico <a href="https://www.yubico.com/2016/05/secure-hardware-vs-open-source/">transitioned</a>
to a less common and more proprietary infrastructure for <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4/">Yubikey
4</a>: it's not longer Javacard based, and they don't provide the
applet source anymore. This was not really seen as a good move by a
lot of people, including <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KonstantinRyabitsev/posts/fjgYKfPMF13">Konstantin
Ryabitsev</a> (kernel.org administrator). Also, it wasn't
possible  even for the Yubico Neo to actually build the applet
yourself and inject it on the card: when the Yubikey leaves the
facility, the applet is already installed and the smartcard is
locked (for obvious security reason). I've tried asking about
getting naked/empty Yubikey with developers keys to load the applet
myself, but it' was apparently not possible or would have required
signing an NDA with NXP (the chip maker), which is not really
possible as an individual (not that I really want to anyway).<br />
<br />
In the meantime, a coworker actually wrote an OpenPGP javacard
applet, with the intention to support latest version of the
<a href="https://gnupg.org/ftp/specs/OpenPGP-smart-card-application-3.3.pdf">
OpenPGP specification</a>, and especially elliptic curve
cryptography. The applet is called SmartPGP and has been <a href="https://github.com/anssi-fr/smartpgp">released</a> on ANSSI github
repository. I investigated a bit, and found a <a href="https://secure.smartcardsource.com/slj52gdl150cl-java-smart-card.html">
smartcard</a> with correct <a href="https://secure.smartcardsource.com/images/filemanager/uploads/infineon-jtop_id_on_sle78.pdf">
specification</a>: certified (in <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/certification_cc/plateforme-jtop-infv46-masquee-sur-composants-infineon-sle78clx1600pm-sle78clx800p-et-sle78clx360pm/">
France</a> or Germany), and supporting Javacard 3.0.4 (required for
ECC). The card can do RSA2048 (unfortunately not RSA4096) and EC
with NIST (secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1) and Brainpool (P256,
P384, P512) curves.<br />
<br />
I've ordered some cards, and when they arrived started playing.
I've built the SmartPGP applet and pushed it to a smartcard, then
generated some keys and tried with GnuPG. I'm right now in the
process of migrating to a new smartcard based on that setup, which
seems to work just fine after few days.<br />
<br />
Part two of this serie will describe how to build the applet and
inject it in the smartcard. The process is already documented here
and there, but there are few things not to forget, like how to lock
the card after provisionning, so I guess having the complete
process somewhere might be useful in case some people want to
reproduce it.</p>

A [long time ago][1], I switched my GnuPG setup to a smartcard based one. I

  * copied the rsa4096 master key to a “master” smartcard, for when I need to sign (certify) other keys;
  * created rsa2048 subkeys (for signature, encryption and authentication) and moved them to an OpenPGP smartcard for daily usage.

machines I work on) never manipulates the private key directly but only sends
request to the card, which is a really huge improvement, in my opinion. But
it's also not the perfect solution for me: the [OpenPGP card][2] uses a
proprietary platform from [ZeitControl][3], named [BasicCard][4]. We have very
few information on the smartcard, besides the fact that Werner Koch trust
ZeistControl to not mess up. One caveat for me is that the card does not use a
certified secure microcontroler like you would find in smartcard chips found
in debit card or electronic IDs. That means it's not really been audited by a
competent hardware lab, and thus can't be considered secure against physical
attacks. The cardOS software and the application implementing the OpenPGP
specification are not public either and have not been audited either, to the
best of my knowledge.  
  
At one point I was interested in the [Yubikey Neo][5], especially since the
architecture Yubico used was common: a (supposedly) certified platform (secure
microcontroler, card OS) and a GlobalPlatform / JavaCard virtual machine. The
applet used in the Yubikey Neo is [open-source][6], too, so you could take a
look at it and identify any issue.  
  
Unfortunately, Yubico [transitioned][7] to a less common and more proprietary infrastructure for [Yubikey 4][8]: it's not longer Javacard based, and they don't provide the applet source anymore. This was not really seen as a good move by a lot of people, including [Konstantin Ryabitsev][9] (kernel.org administrator). Also, it wasn't possible even for the Yubico Neo to actually build the applet yourself and inject it on the card: when the Yubikey leaves the facility, the applet is already installed and the smartcard is locked (for obvious security reason). I've tried asking about getting naked/empty Yubikey with developers keys to load the applet myself, but it' was apparently not possible or would have required signing an NDA with NXP (the chip maker), which is not really possible as an individual (not that I really want to anyway).  
  
In the meantime, a coworker actually wrote an OpenPGP javacard applet, with the intention to support latest version of the [ OpenPGP specification][10], and especially elliptic curve cryptography. The applet is called SmartPGP and has been [released][11] on ANSSI github repository. I investigated a bit, and found a [ smartcard][12] with correct [ specification][13]: certified (in [ France][14] or Germany), and supporting Javacard 3.0.4 (required for ECC). The card can do RSA2048 (unfortunately not RSA4096) and EC with NIST (secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1) and Brainpool (P256, P384, P512) curves.  
  
I've ordered some cards, and when they arrived started playing. I've built the
SmartPGP applet and pushed it to a smartcard, then generated some keys and
tried with GnuPG. I'm right now in the process of migrating to a new smartcard
based on that setup, which seems to work just fine after few days.  
  
Part two of this serie will describe how to build the applet and inject it in
the smartcard. The process is already documented here and there, but there are
few things not to forget, like how to lock the card after provisionning, so I
guess having the complete process somewhere might be useful in case some
people want to reproduce it.

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/lars.png" width="85" height="100" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> is a new EU regulation for privacy. The name is short for
"General Data Protection Regulation" and it covers all organisations
that handle personal data of EU citizens and EU residents. It will
become enforceable May 25, 2018 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day">Towel Day</a>). This will affect
Debian. I think it's time for Debian to start working on compliance,
mainly because the GDPR requires sensible things.</p>

<p>I'm not an expert on GDPR legislation, but here's my understanding of
what we in Debian should do:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>do a privacy impact assessment, to review and <strong>document</strong> what
data we have, and collect, and what risks that has for the people
whose personal data it is if the data leaks</p></li>
<li><p>only collect personal information for specific purposes, and only
use the data for those purposes</p></li>
<li><p>get explicit consent from each person for all collection and use of
their personal information; archive this consent (e.g., list
subscription confirmations)</p></li>
<li><p>allow each person to get a copy of all the personal information
we have about them, in a portable manner, and let them correct it if
it's wrong</p></li>
<li><p>allow people to have their personal information erased</p></li>
<li><p>maybe appoint one or more data protection officers (not sure this is
required for Debian)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There's more, but let's start with those.</p>

http://blog.liw.fi/posts/2017/10/10/debian_and_the_gdpr/

[GDPR][1] is a new EU regulation for privacy. The name is short for "General
Data Protection Regulation" and it covers all organisations that handle
personal data of EU citizens and EU residents. It will become enforceable May
25, 2018 ([Towel Day][2]). This will affect Debian. I think it's time for
Debian to start working on compliance, mainly because the GDPR requires
sensible things.

   [1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation>
   [2]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day>

I'm not an expert on GDPR legislation, but here's my understanding of what we
in Debian should do:

  * do a privacy impact assessment, to review and **document** what data we have, and collect, and what risks that has for the people whose personal data it is if the data leaks

  * only collect personal information for specific purposes, and only use the data for those purposes

  * get explicit consent from each person for all collection and use of their personal information; archive this consent (e.g., list subscription confirmations)

  * allow each person to get a copy of all the personal information we have about them, in a portable manner, and let them correct it if it's wrong

  * allow people to have their personal information erased

  * maybe appoint one or more data protection officers (not sure this is required for Debian)

There's more, but let's start with those.

I think Debian has at least the following systems that will need to be
reviewed with regards to the GDPR:

  * db.debian.org - Debian project members, "Debian developers"
  * nm.debian.org
  * contributors.debian.org
  * lists.debian.org - **at least** membership lists, maybe archives
  * possibly irc servers and log files
  * mail server log files
  * web server log files
  * version control services and repositories

There may be more; these are just off the top of my head.

I expect that mostly Debian will be OK, but we can't just assume that.

Subject: Vincent Fourmond: Define a function with inline Ruby code in QSoas

<a href="http://qsoas.org">QSoas</a> can read and execute Ruby code directly, while reading command files, or even at the command prompt. For that, just write plain Ruby code inside a <code>ruby</code>...<code>ruby end</code> block. Probably the most useful possibility is to define elaborated functions directly from within <code>QSoas</code>, or, preferable, from within a script; this is an alternative to defining a function in a completely separated Ruby-only file using <a href="http://qsoas.org/manual.html#cmd-ruby-run">ruby-run</a>. For instance, you can define a function for plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics">Michaelis-Menten kinetics</a> with a file containing:<br />
<br />
<pre>ruby
def my_func(x, vm, km)
  return vm/(1 + km/x)
end
ruby end
</pre><br />
This defines the function <code>my_func</code> with three parameters, ,  (<code>vm</code>) and (<code>km</code>), with the formula: <br />
<br />
You can then test that the function has been correctly defined running for instance:<br />
<br />
<pre>QSoas&gt; eval my_func(1.0,1.0,1.0)
 =&gt; 0.5
QSoas&gt; eval my_func(1e4,1.0,1.0)
 =&gt; 0.999900009999
</pre><br />
This yields the correct answer: the first command evaluates the function with <code>x = 1.0</code>, <code>vm = 1.0</code> and <code>km = 1.0</code>. For , the result is  (here <code>0.5</code>). For , the result is almost . You can use the newly defined <code>my_func</code> in any place you would use any ruby code, such as in the <a href="http://vince-debian.blogspot.fr/2017/02/extended-dataset-generation.html">optional argument to generate-buffer</a>, or for <a href="http://qsoas.org/manual.html#arbitrary-fits">arbitrary fits</a>:<br />
<br />
<pre>QSoas&gt; generate-buffer 0 10 my_func(x,3.0,0.6)
QSoas&gt; fit-arb my_func(x,vm,km)
</pre><br />
To redefine <code>my_func</code>, just run the ruby code again with a new definition, such as:<br />
<pre>ruby
def my_func(x, vm, km)
  return vm/(1 + km/x**2)
end
ruby end
</pre>The previous version is just erased, and all new uses of <code>my_func</code> will refer to your new definition.<br />
<br />

http://vince-debian.blogspot.com/2017/10/define-function-with-inline-ruby-code.html

[QSoas][1] can read and execute Ruby code directly, while reading command
files, or even at the command prompt. For that, just write plain Ruby code
inside a `ruby`...`ruby end` block. Probably the most useful possibility is to
define elaborated functions directly from within `QSoas`, or, preferable, from
within a script; this is an alternative to defining a function in a completely
separated Ruby-only file using [ruby-run][2]. For instance, you can define a
function for plain [Michaelis-Menten kinetics][3] with a file containing:  
  

    
       [1]: <http://qsoas.org>
   [2]: <http://qsoas.org/manual.html#cmd-ruby-run>
   [3]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics>

    ruby
    def my_func(x, vm, km)
      return vm/(1 + km/x)
    end
    ruby end
    

  
This defines the function `my_func` with three parameters, , (`vm`) and
(`km`), with the formula:  
  
You can then test that the function has been correctly defined running for
instance:  
  

    
    
    QSoas> eval my_func(1.0,1.0,1.0)
     => 0.5
    QSoas> eval my_func(1e4,1.0,1.0)
     => 0.999900009999
    

  
This yields the correct answer: the first command evaluates the function with `x = 1.0`, `vm = 1.0` and `km = 1.0`. For , the result is (here `0.5`). For , the result is almost . You can use the newly defined `my_func` in any place you would use any ruby code, such as in the [optional argument to generate-buffer][4], or for [arbitrary fits][5]:  
  

    
       [4]: <http://vince-debian.blogspot.fr/2017/02/extended-dataset-generation.html>
   [5]: <http://qsoas.org/manual.html#arbitrary-fits>

    QSoas> generate-buffer 0 10 my_func(x,3.0,0.6)
    QSoas> fit-arb my_func(x,vm,km)
    

  
To redefine `my_func`, just run the ruby code again with a new definition,
such as:  

    
    
    ruby
    def my_func(x, vm, km)
      return vm/(1 + km/x**2)
    end
    ruby end
    

The previous version is just erased, and all new uses of `my_func` will refer
to your new definition.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://packages.debian.org/pristine-tar">pristine-tar</a> is a tool that is present in the workflow of a lot of Debian people. I adopted it last year after it has been orphaned by its creator <a href="https://joeyh.name/">Joey Hess</a>. A little after that <a href="https://tomasz.buchert.pl/">Tomasz Buchert</a> joined me and we are now a functional two-person team.</p>
<p>pristine-tar goals are to import the content of a pristine upstream tarball into a <span class="caps">VCS</span> repository, and being able to later reconstruct that exact same tarball, bit by bit, based on the contents in the <span class="caps">VCS</span>, so we don’t have to store a full copy of that tarball. This is done by storing a binary delta files which can be used to reconstruct the original tarball from a tarball produced with the contents of the <span class="caps">VCS</span>. Ultimately, we want to make sure that the tarball that is uploaded to Debian is exactly the same as the one that has been downloaded from upstream, without having to keep a full copy of it around if all of its contents is already extracted in the <span class="caps">VCS</span> anyway.</p>
<h2>The current state of the art, and perspectives for the future</h2>
<p>pristine-tar solves a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wicked problem</a>, because our ability to reconstruct the original tarball is affected by changes in the behavior of <code>tar</code> and of all of the compression tools (<code>gzip</code>, <code>bzip2</code>, <code>xz</code>) and by what exact options were used when creating the original tarballs. Because of this, pristine-tar currently has a few embedded copies of old versions of compressors to be able to reconstruct tarballs produced by them, and also rely on a ever-evolving patch to tar that is been carried in Debian for a while.</p>
<p>So basically keeping pristine-tar working is a game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole">Whac-A-Mole</a>. Joey provided a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=737871">good summary of the situation when he orphaned pristine-tar</a>.</p>
<p>Going forward, we may need to rely on other ways of ensuring integrity of upstream source code. That could take the form of signed git tags, signed uncompressed tarballs (so that the compression doesn’t matter), or maybe even a different system for storing actual tarballs. <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=871806">Debian bug #871806</a> contains an interesting discussion on this topic.</p>
<h2>Recent improvements</h2>
<p>Even if keeping pristine-tar useful in the long term  will be hard, too much of Debian work currently relies on it, so we can’t just abandon it. Instead, we keep figuring out ways to improve. And I have good news: pristine-tar has recently received updates that improve the situation quite a bit.</p>
<p>In order to be able to understand how better we are getting at it, I created a "visualization of the <a href="https://people.debian.org/~terceiro/pristine-tar/">regression test suite results</a>. With the help of data from there, let’s look at the improvements made since pristine-tar 1.38, which was the version included in stretch.</p>
<h3>pristine-tar 1.39: xdelta3 by default.</h3>
<p>This was the first release made after the stretch release, and made <code>xdelta3</code> the default delta generator for newly-imported tarballs. Existing tarballs with deltas produced by <code>xdelta</code> are still supported, this only affects new imports.</p>
<p>The support for having multiple delta generator was written by Tomasz, and was already there since 1.35, but we decided to only flip the switch after using xdelta3 was supported in a stable release.</p>
<h3>pristine-tar 1.40: improved compression heuristics</h3>

## Introduction

[pristine-tar][1] is a tool that is present in the workflow of a lot of Debian
people. I adopted it last year after it has been orphaned by its creator [Joey
Hess][2]. A little after that [Tomasz Buchert][3] joined me and we are now a
functional two-person team.

   [1]: <https://packages.debian.org/pristine-tar>
   [2]: <https://joeyh.name/>
   [3]: <https://tomasz.buchert.pl/>

pristine-tar goals are to import the content of a pristine upstream tarball
into a VCS repository, and being able to later reconstruct that exact same
tarball, bit by bit, based on the contents in the VCS, so we don’t have to
store a full copy of that tarball. This is done by storing a binary delta
files which can be used to reconstruct the original tarball from a tarball
produced with the contents of the VCS. Ultimately, we want to make sure that
the tarball that is uploaded to Debian is exactly the same as the one that has
been downloaded from upstream, without having to keep a full copy of it around
if all of its contents is already extracted in the VCS anyway.

## The current state of the art, and perspectives for the future

pristine-tar solves a [wicked problem][4], because our ability to reconstruct
the original tarball is affected by changes in the behavior of `tar` and of
all of the compression tools (`gzip`, `bzip2`, `xz`) and by what exact options
were used when creating the original tarballs. Because of this, pristine-tar
currently has a few embedded copies of old versions of compressors to be able
to reconstruct tarballs produced by them, and also rely on a ever-evolving
patch to tar that is been carried in Debian for a while.

   [4]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem>

So basically keeping pristine-tar working is a game of [Whac-A-Mole][5]. Joey
provided a [good summary of the situation when he orphaned pristine-tar][6].

   [5]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole>
   [6]: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=737871>

Going forward, we may need to rely on other ways of ensuring integrity of
upstream source code. That could take the form of signed git tags, signed
uncompressed tarballs (so that the compression doesn’t matter), or maybe even
a different system for storing actual tarballs. [Debian bug #871806][7]
contains an interesting discussion on this topic.

   [7]: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=871806>

## Recent improvements

Even if keeping pristine-tar useful in the long term will be hard, too much of
Debian work currently relies on it, so we can’t just abandon it. Instead, we
keep figuring out ways to improve. And I have good news: pristine-tar has
recently received updates that improve the situation quite a bit.

In order to be able to understand how better we are getting at it, I created a
"visualization of the [regression test suite results][8]. With the help of
data from there, let’s look at the improvements made since pristine-tar 1.38,
which was the version included in stretch.

   [8]: <https://people.debian.org/~terceiro/pristine-tar/>

### pristine-tar 1.39: xdelta3 by default.

This was the first release made after the stretch release, and made `xdelta3`
the default delta generator for newly-imported tarballs. Existing tarballs
with deltas produced by `xdelta` are still supported, this only affects new
imports.

The support for having multiple delta generator was written by Tomasz, and was
already there since 1.35, but we decided to only flip the switch after using
xdelta3 was supported in a stable release.

### pristine-tar 1.40: improved compression heuristics

pristine-tar uses a few heuristics to produce the smaller delta possible, and
this includes trying different compression options. In the release Tomasz
included a contribution by Lennart Sorensen to also try the `--gnu`, which
gretly improved the support for rsyncable gzip compressed files. We can see an
example of the type of improvement we got in the [regression test suite data
for delta sizes][9] for `faad2_2.6.1.orig.tar.gz`:

   [9]: <https://people.debian.org/~terceiro/pristine-tar/>

In 1.40, the delta produced from the test tarball faad2_2.6.1.orig.tar.gz went
down from 800KB, almost the same size of tarball itself, to 6.8KB

### pristine-tar 1.41: support for signatures

This release saw the addition of support for storage and retrieval of upstream
signatures, contributed by Chris Lamb.

### pristine-tar 1.42: optionally recompressing tarballs

I had this idea and wanted to try it out: most of our problems reproducing
tarballs come from tarballs produced with old compressors, or from changes in
compressor behavior, or from uncommon compression options being used. What if
we could just recompress the tarballs before importing then? Yes, this kind of
breaks the “pristine” bit of the whole business, but on the other hand, 1) the
contents of the tarball are not affected, and 2) even if the initial tarball
is not bit by bit the same that upstream release, at least future uploads of
that same upstream version with Debian revisions can be regenerated just fine.

In some cases, as the case for the test tarball `util-
linux_2.30.1.orig.tar.xz`, recompressing is what makes it possible to
reproduce the tarball (and thus import it with pristine-tar) possible at all:

util-linux_2.30.1.orig.tar.xz can only be imported after being recompressed

In other cases, if the current heuristics can’t produce a reasonably small
delta, recompressing makes a huge difference. It’s the case for
`mumble_1.1.8.orig.tar.gz`:

with recompression, the delta produced from mumble_1.1.8.orig.tar.gz goes from
1.2MB, or 99% of the size to the original tarball, to 14.6KB, 1% of the size
of original tarball

Recompressing is not enabled by default, and can be enabled by passing the
`--recompress` option. If you are using `pristine-tar` via a wrapper tool like
`gbp-buildpackage`, you can use the `$PRISTINE_TAR` environment variable to
set options that will affect any pristine-tar invocations.

Also, even if you enable recompression, pristine-tar will only try it if the
delta generations fails completely, of if the delta produced from the original
tarball is too large. You can control what “too large” means by using the
`--recompress-threshold-bytes` and `--recompress-threshold-percent` options.
See the **pristine-tar(1)** manual page for details.

<p>At my nearby maker space,
<a href="http://sonen.ifi.uio.no/">Sonen</a>, I heard the story that it
was easier to generate gcode files for theyr 3D printers (Ultimake 2+)
on Windows and MacOS X than Linux, because the software involved had
to be manually compiled and set up on Linux while premade packages
worked out of the box on Windows and MacOS X.  I found this annoying,
as the software involved,
<a href="https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura">Cura</a>, is free software
and should be trivial to get up and running on Linux if someone took
the time to package it for the relevant distributions.  I even found
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/706656">a request for adding into
Debian</a> from 2013, which had seem some activity over the years but
never resulted in the software showing up in Debian.  So a few days
ago I offered my help to try to improve the situation.</p>

<p>Now I am very happy to see that all the packages required by a
working Cura in Debian are uploaded into Debian and waiting in the NEW
queue for the ftpmasters to have a look.  You can track the progress
on
<a href="https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?email=3dprinter-general%40lists.alioth.debian.org">the

<p>The uploaded packages are a bit behind upstream, and was uploaded
now to get slots in <a href="https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html">the NEW

<p>On a related note, two competitors for Cura, which I found harder
to use and was unable to configure correctly for Ultimaker 2+ in the
short time I spent on it, are already in Debian.  If you are looking

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/irl.png" width="80" height="80" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>Here’s my weekly report for week 40 of 2017. In this week I have <a href="https://iain.learmonth.me/blog/2017/2017w401/">looked at
censorship in Catalonia</a> and
<a href="https://iain.learmonth.me/blog/2017/2017w402/">had my “deleted” Facebook account
hacked</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15391933">which made HN front

about DRM on the web</a>.</p>

<h2 id="debian">Debian</h2>

<p>I have prepared and uploaded fixes for the
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/measurement-kit">measurement-kit</a> and
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/hamradio-maintguide">hamradio-maintguide</a>

<p>I have also sponsored uploads for
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/gnustep-base">gnustep-base</a> (to
experimental) and
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=875895">chkservice</a>.</p>

<p>I have given DM upload privileges to <a href="https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?email=Heintzmann.Eric%40free.fr">Eric
Heintzmann</a>
for the gnustep-base package as he has shown to care for the GNUstep packages
well. In the near future, I think we’re looking at a transition for
gnustep-{base,back,gui} as these packages all have updates.</p>

<p>Bugs filed: <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/877680">#877680</a></p>

<p>Bugs closed (fixed/wontfix): <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/872202">#872202</a>,

<h2 id="tor-project">Tor Project</h2>

<p>This week I have participated in a discussion around <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/23716#comment:2">renaming the “Operations”
section</a> of
the <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/">Metrics website</a>.</p>

<p>I have also filed a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/23767">new ticket on

planning to implement, to link to the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/lifecycle-new-relay">new relay
lifecycle</a> post on the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/">Tor
Project blog</a> if a relay is less than a week old
to help new relay operators understand the bandwidth usage they’ll be seeing.</p>

<p>Finally, I’ve been hacking on a <a href="https://twitter.com/TorAtlas">Twitter bot to tweet factoids about the public
Tor network</a>. I’ve detailed this <a href="https://iain.learmonth.me/blog/2017/2017w407/">in a separate
blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Bugs closed (fixed/wontfix): <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/23683">#23683</a></p>

<h2 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h2>

<p>I believe it is important to be clear not only about the work I have already
completed but also about the sustainability of this work into the future. I
plan to include a short report on the current sustainability of my work in each
weekly report.</p>

<p>I have not had any free software related expenses this week. The current funds
I have available for equipment, travel and other free software expenses remains
£60.52. I do not believe that any hardware I rely on is looking at imminent
failure.</p>

Here’s my weekly report for week 40 of 2017. In this week I have [looked at censorship in Catalonia][1] and [had my “deleted” Facebook account hacked][2] ([which made HN front page][3]). I’ve also [been thinking about DRM on the web][4].

## Debian

I have prepared and uploaded fixes for the [measurement-kit][5] and [hamradio-
maintguide][6] packages.

   [5]: <https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/measurement-kit>
   [6]: <https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/hamradio-maintguide>

I have also sponsored uploads for [gnustep-base][7] (to experimental) and [chkservice][8].

   [7]: <https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/gnustep-base>
   [8]: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=875895>

I have given DM upload privileges to [Eric Heintzmann][9] for the gnustep-base
package as he has shown to care for the GNUstep packages well. In the near
future, I think we’re looking at a transition for gnustep-{base,back,gui} as
these packages all have updates.

## Tor Project

This week I have participated in a discussion around [renaming the
“Operations” section][14] of the [Metrics website][15].

   [14]: <https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/23716#comment:2>
   [15]: <https://metrics.torproject.org/>

I have also filed a [new ticket on Atlas][16], which I am planning to
implement, to link to the [new relay lifecycle][17] post on the [Tor Project
blog][18] if a relay is less than a week old to help new relay operators
understand the bandwidth usage they’ll be seeing.

Finally, I’ve been hacking on a [Twitter bot to tweet factoids about the
public Tor network][19]. I’ve detailed this [in a separate blog post][20].

## Sustainability

I believe it is important to be clear not only about the work I have already
completed but also about the sustainability of this work into the future. I
plan to include a short report on the current sustainability of my work in
each weekly report.

I have not had any free software related expenses this week. The current funds
I have available for equipment, travel and other free software expenses
remains £60.52. I do not believe that any hardware I rely on is looking at
imminent failure.

<p>
I previously wrote about <a href="https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/2017/03/22/raspberry-pi-3.html">my
Debian stretch preview image for the Raspberry Pi 3</a>.
</p>

<p>
Now, I’m publishing an updated version, containing the following changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
SSH host keys are generated on first boot.
</li>
<li>
Old kernel versions are now removed from /boot/firmware when purged.
</li>
<li>
The image is built
with <a href="https://github.com/larswirzenius/vmdb2">vmdb2</a>, the successor
to vmdebootstrap. The input files are available
at <a href="https://github.com/Debian/raspi3-image-spec">https://github.com/Debian/raspi3-image-spec</a>.
</li>
<li>
The image uses the linux-image-arm64 4.13.4-3 kernel, which provides HDMI output.
</li>
<li>
The image is now compressed using bzip2, reducing its size to 220M.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A couple of issues remain, notably the lack of WiFi and bluetooth support
(see <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/RaspberryPi3">wiki:RaspberryPi3</a> for details.
Any help with fixing these issues is very welcome!
</p>

<p>
As a <strong>preview version</strong> (i.e. unofficial, unsupported, etc.)
until all the necessary bits and pieces are in place to build images in a
proper place in Debian, I built and uploaded the resulting image. Find it at <a href="https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/raspberrypi3/2017-10-08/">https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/raspberrypi3/2017-10-08/</a>.
To install the image, insert the SD card into your computer (I’m assuming it’s
available as <code>/dev/sdb</code>) and copy the image onto it:
</p>

<pre>$ wget https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/raspberrypi3/2017-10-08/2017-10-08-raspberry-pi-3-buster-PREVIEW.img.bz2
$ bunzip2 2017-10-08-raspberry-pi-3-buster-PREVIEW.img.bz2
$ sudo dd if=2017-10-08-raspberry-pi-3-buster-PREVIEW.img of=/dev/sdb bs=5M
</pre>

<p>
If resolving client-supplied DHCP hostnames works in your network, you should
be able to log into the Raspberry Pi 3 using SSH after booting it:
</p>

<pre>$ ssh root@rpi3
# Password is “raspberry”

When I learned TeX, I was told to not write `e.g. something`, because TeX
would think the period after the “g” ends a sentence, and introduce a wider,
inter-sentence space. Instead, I was to write `e.g.\␣`.

Years later, I learned from a convincing, but since forgotten source, that in
fact `e.g.\@` is the proper thing to write. I vaguely remembering that
`e.g.\␣` supposedly affected the inter-word space in some unwanted way. So I
did that for many years.

Until I recently was called out for doing it wrong, and that infact `e.g.\␣`
is the proper way. This was supported by [a StackExchange answer][1] written
by a LaTeX authority and backed by a reference to documentation. The same
question has, however, [another answer][2] by another TeX authority, backed by
an analysis of the implementation, which concludes that `e.g.\@` is proper.

   [2]: <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/22564/15107>

What now? I guess I just have to find it out myself.

The problem and two solutions

The problem and two solutions

The above image shows three variants: The obviously broken version with
`e.g.`, and the two contesting variants to fix it. Looks like they yield equal
results!

So maybe the difference lies in how `\@` and `\␣` react when the line length
changes, and the word wrapping require differences in the inter-word spacing.
Will there be differences? Let’s see;

Expanding whitespace, take 1

Expanding whitespace, take 1

Expanding whitespace, take 2

Expanding whitespace, take 2

I cannot see any difference. But the inter-sentence whitespace ate most of the
expansion. Is there a difference visible if we have only inter-word spacing in
the line?

Expanding whitespace, take 3

Expanding whitespace, take 3

Expanding whitespace, take 4

Expanding whitespace, take 4

Again, I see the same behaviour.

**Conclusion** : It does not matter, but `e.g.\␣` is less hassle when using
[lhs2tex][3] than `e.g.\@` (which has to be escaped as `e.g.\@@`), so the
winner is `e.g.\␣`!

   [3]: <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lhs2tex>

(Unless you put it in a macro, [then `\@` might be preferable][4], and it is
still [needed between a captial letter and a sentence period][5].)

Have you been to an event recently involving [free software][1] or a related
topic? How did you find it? Are you organizing an event and don't want to fall
into the trap of using Facebook or Meetup or other services that compete for a
share of your community's attention?

   [1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>

Are you keen to find events in foreign destinations related to your interest
areas to coincide with other travel intentions?

Have you been concerned when your [GSoC or Outreachy][2] interns lost a week
of their project going through the bureaucracy to get a visa for your
community's event? Would you like to make it easier for them to find the best
events in the countries that welcome and respect visitors?

   [2]: <https://danielpocock.com/tags/gsoc>

In many recent discussions about free software activism, people have struggled
to break out of the illusion that social media is the way to cultivate new
contacts. Wouldn't it be great to make more meaningful contacts by attending
more a more diverse range of events rather [than losing time on social
media][3]?

   [3]: <https://danielpocock.com/how-did-the-world-ever-work-without-facebook>

### Making it happen

There are already a number of tools (for example, [Drupal plugins][4] and
[Wordpress plugins][5]) for promoting your events on the web and in [iCalendar
format][6]. There are also a number of sites like [Agenda du Libre][7] and
[GriCal][8] who aggregate events from multiple communities where people can
browse them.

   [4]: <https://www.drupal.org/search/site/icalendar>
   [5]: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/icalendar/>
   [6]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar>
   [7]: <https://www.agendadulibre.org/>
   [8]: <http://grical.org/>

How can we take these concepts further and make a convenient, compelling and
global solution?

Can we harvest event data from a wide range of sources and compile it into a
large database using something like [PostgreSQL][9] or a NoSQL solution or
even a distributed solution like [OpenDHT][10]?

   [9]: <https://www.postgresql.org>
   [10]: <https://blog.savoirfairelinux.com/en-ca/2015/ring-opendht-a-distributed-hash-table/>

Can we use big data techniques to mine these datasources and help match people
to events without compromising on privacy?

Why not build an automated iCalendar "to-do" list of deadlines for events you
want to be reminded about, so you never miss the deadlines for travel
sponsorship or submitting a talk proposal?

I've started [documenting an architecture for this on the Debian wiki][11] and
proposed it as an [Outreachy project][12]. It will also be offered as part of
GSoC in 2018.

One of the reasons which made me switch my old 17" BenQ monitor for a Dell
U2413 three years ago was it had an integrated SD card reader. I find very
convenient to take camera's card out, plug the card into the monitor and click
on KDE device monitor's option “Open with [digiKam][1]” to download the photos
or videos.  
  
But last week, when trying to reconnect the USB cable to the new board just
didn't work and the kernel log messages were not very hopeful:

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/irl.png" width="80" height="80" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>A while ago I played with <a href="https://twitter.com/hamlocator">a Twitter bot</a> that
would track <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio">radio amateurs</a> using
a <a href="http://www.aprs-is.net/">packet radio position reporting system</a>, tweet
their location and a picture from Flickr that was taken near to their location
and a link to their packet radio activity on <a href="http://aprs.fi/">aprs.fi</a>. It’s
really not that hard to put these things together and they can be a lot of fun.
The tweets looked like this:</p>

<p>This isn’t about building a system that serves any critical purpose, it’s about
fun. As the radio stations were chosen essentially at random, there could be
some cool things showing up that you wouldn’t otherwise have seen. Maybe you’d

perhaps you’ll spot something insightful or interesting. Not every tweet is
going to be amazing, but it wasn’t running for very long before I spotted a
relay very close to its 10th birthday:</p>

<p>The relays are chosen at random, and tweet templates are chosen at random too.
So far, tweets about individual relays can be about age or current bandwidth
contribution to the Tor network. There are also tweets about how many relays
run in a particular autonomous system (again, chosen at random) and tweets
about the total number of relays currently running. The total relays tweets
come with a map:</p>

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/lamby.png" width="70" height="87" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>I've just released <a class="reference external" href="https://chris-lamb.co.uk/projects/python-gfshare">python-gfshare</a>, a Python library that implements <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir’s method for secret sharing</a>, a technique to split a "secret" into multiple parts.</p>
<p>An arbitrary number of those parts are then needed to recover the original file but any smaller combination of parts are useless to an attacker.</p>
<p>For instance, you might split a GPG key into a “3-of-5” share, putting one share on each of three computers and two shares on a USB memory stick. You can then use the GPG key on any of those three computers using the memory stick.</p>
<p>If the memory stick is lost you can ultimately recover the key by bringing the three computers back together again.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">$ pip install gfshare
</pre>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">gfshare</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">shares</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">gfshare</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s2">"secret"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">shares</span>

 <span class="mi">171</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'&gt;</span><span class="se">\xf5</span><span class="s1">*</span><span class="se">\xce\xa2\xe2</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="p">,</span>

</pre></div>
<p>After removing two "shares" we can still reconstruct the secret as we have 3 out of the 5 originals:</p>

https://chris-lamb.co.uk/posts/python-gfshare-secret-sharing-in-python

I've just released [python-gfshare][1], a Python library that implements
[Shamir’s method for secret sharing][2], a technique to split a "secret" into
multiple parts.

   [1]: <https://chris-lamb.co.uk/projects/python-gfshare>
   [2]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing>

An arbitrary number of those parts are then needed to recover the original
file but any smaller combination of parts are useless to an attacker.

For instance, you might split a GPG key into a “3-of-5” share, putting one
share on each of three computers and two shares on a USB memory stick. You can
then use the GPG key on any of those three computers using the memory stick.

If the memory stick is lost you can ultimately recover the key by bringing the
three computers back together again.

For example:

    
    
    $ pip install gfshare
    
    
    
    >>> import gfshare
    >>> shares = gfshare.split(3, 5, b"secret")
    >>> shares
    {104: b'1\x9cQ\xd8\xd3\xaf',
     164: b'\x15\xa4\xcf7R\xd2',
     171: b'>\xf5*\xce\xa2\xe2',
     173: b'd\xd1\xaaR\xa5\x1d',
     183: b'\x0c\xb4Y\x8apC'}
    >>> gfshare.combine(shares)
    b"secret"
    

After removing two "shares" we can still reconstruct the secret as we have 3
out of the 5 originals:

    
    
    >>> del shares['104']
    >>> del shares['171']
    >>> gfshare.combine(shares)
    b"secret"
    

Under the hood it uses Daniel Silverstone’s [libgfshare][3] library. The
source code is [available on GitHub][4] as is the [documentation][5].

   [3]: <http://www.digital-scurf.org/software/libgfshare>
   [4]: <https://github.com/lamby/python-gfshare>
   [5]: <https://lamby.github.io/python-gfshare/>

Patches welcome.

### Debian LTS

This month I was allocated 12h but I only spent 10.5h. During this time, I
continued my work on exiv2. I finished reproducing all the issues and then
went on doing code reviews to confirm that vulnerabilities were not present
when the issue was not reproducible. I found two CVE where the vulnerability
was present in the wheezy version and I posted patches in the upstream bug
tracker: [#57][2] and [#55][3].

   [2]: <https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/57#issuecomment-333086302>
   [3]: <https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/55#issuecomment-332240966>

Then another batch of 10 CVE appeared and I started the process over… I’m
currently trying to reproduce the issues.

While doing all this work on exiv2, I also uncovered a failure to build on the
package in experimental (reported [here][4]).

   [4]: <https://bugs.debian.org/876948>

### Misc Debian/Kali work

**Debian Live**. I merged 3 live-build patches prepared by Matthijs Kooijman
and added an armel fix to cope with the the rename of the orion5x image into
the marvell one. I also uploaded a new live-config to fix a [bug with the
keyboard configuration][5]. Finally, I also released a new live-installer udeb
to cope with a recent live-build change that broke the locale selection during
the installation process.

   [5]: <https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=4239>

**Debian Installer**. I prepared a [few patches][6] on pkgsel to merge a few
features that had been added to Ubuntu, most notably the possibility to enable
unattended-upgrades by default.

   [6]: <https://bugs.debian.org/875858>

**More bug reports**. I investigated much further my problem with non-booting
qemu images when they are built by vmdebootstrap in a chroot managed by
schroot (cf [#872999][7]) and while we have much more data, it’s not yet clear
why it doesn’t work. But we have a working work-around…

While investigating issues seen in Kali, I opened a bunch of reports on the
Debian side:

  * [#874657][8]: pcmanfm: should have explicit recommends on lxpolkit | polkit-1-auth-agent 
  * [#874626][9]: bin-nmu request to complete two transitions and bring back some packages in testing

pizza. After a successful Factory Acceptance Test today, I might also allow
myself to celebrate with a beer. But anyway, here is what I have been up to in
the FLOSS world for the last month and a bit.

### Debian

  * Uploaded [gramps][1] (4.2.6) to stretch-backports & jessie-backports-sloppy.
  * Started working on the latest release of [node-tmp][2]. It needs further work due to new documentation being included etc.
  * Started working on packaging the latest [goocanvas-2.0][3] package. Everything is ready except for producing some autopkgtests.
  * Moved [node-coffeeify][4] experimental to unstable.
  * Updated the [Multimedia Blends Tasks][5] with all the latest ITPs etc.
  * Reviewed [doris][6] for Antonio Valentino, and sponsored it for him.
  * Reviewed [pyresample][7] for Antonio Valentino, and sponsored it for him.
  * Reviewed a new [parlatype][8] package for Gabor Karsay, and sponsored it for him.

### Ubuntu

  * Successfully did my first merge using [git-ubuntu][9] for the [Qjackctl][10] package. Thanks to Nish for patiently answering my questions, reviewing my work, and sponsoring the upload.
  * Refreshed the [gramps backport request to 4.2.6][11]. Still no willing sponsor.
  * Tested Len’s rewrite of [ubuntustudio-controls][12], adding a CPU governor option in particular. There are a couple of minor things to tidy up, but we have probably missed the chance to get it finalised for Artful.
  * Tested the First Beta release of Ubuntu Studio 17.10 Artful and wrote the [release notes][13]. Also drafted my first release announcement on the Ubunti Studio website which Eylul reviewed and published.

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/wouter3.png" width="85" height="80" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>At work, I help maintain a <a href="https://eid.belgium.be">smartcard</a>
<a href="https://github.com/Fedict/eid-mw">middleware</a> that is provided to
Belgian citizens who want to use their electronic ID card to, e.g., log
on to government websites. This middleware is a piece of software that
hooks into various browsers and adds a way to access the smartcard in
question, through whatever APIs the operating system and the browser in
question provide for that purpose. The details of how that is done
differ between each browser (and in the case of Google Chrome, for the
same browser between different operating systems); but for Firefox (and
Google Chrome on free operating systems), this is done by way of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11">PKCS#11</a> module.</p>

<p>For Firefox 57, mozilla decided to overhaul much of their browser. The
changes are large and massive, and in some ways revolutionary. It's no
surprise, therefore, that some of the changes break compatibility with
older things.</p>

<p>One of the areas in which breaking changes were made is in the area of
extensions to the browser. Previously, Firefox had various APIs
available for extensions; right now, all APIs apart from the
WebExtensions API are considered "legacy" and support for them will be
removed from Firefox 57 going forward.</p>

<p>Since installing a PKCS#11 module manually is a bit complicated, and
since the legacy APIs provided a way to do so automatically provided the
user would first install an add-on (or provided the installer of the
PKCS#11 module sideloads it), most parties who provide a PKCS#11 module
for use with Firefox will provide an add-on to automatically install it.
Since the alternative involves entering the right values in a dialog box

<p>I'm sure you can imagine my dismay when I found out that there was no
WebExtensions API to provide the same functionality. So, after asking
around a bit, I filed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1357391">bug
1357391</a> to get a
discussion started. While it took some convincing initially to get
people to understand the reasons for wanting such an API, eventually the
bug was assigned the "P5" priority -- essentially, a "we understand the
need and won't block it, but we don't have the time to implement it.
Patches welcome, though" statement.</p>

<p>Since having an add-on was something that work really wanted, and since
I had the time, I got the go-ahead from management to look into
implementing the required code myself. I made it obvious rather quickly
that my background in Firefox was fairly limited, though, and so was
assigned a mentor to help me through the process.</p>

<p>Having been a Debian Developer for the past fifteen years, I do
understand how to develop free software. Yet, the experience was
different enough that still learned some new things about free software
development, which was somewhat unexpected.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the process took much longer than I had hoped, which
meant that the patch was not ready by the time Firefox 57 was branched
off mozilla's "central" repository. The result of that is that while my
patch has been merged into what will eventually become Firefox 58, it
looks strongly as though it won't make it into Firefox 57. That's going
to cause some severe headaches, which I'm not looking forward to; and
while I can certainly understand the reasons for not wanting to grant
the exception for the merge into 57, I can't help but feeling like this
is a missed opportunity.</p>

<p>Anyway, writing code for the massive Open Source project that mozilla is
has been a load of fun, and in the process I've learned a lot -- not
only about Open Source development in general, but also about this weird
little thing that Javascript is. That might actually be useful for this
<a href="https://github.com/yoe/sreview">other project</a> that I've got running
here.</p>

<p>In closing, I'd like to thank Tomislav 'zombie' Jovanovic for mentoring
me during the whole process, without whom it would have been doubtful if
I would even have been ready by now. Apologies for any procedural
mistakes I've made, and good luck in your future endeavours! <img alt=":-)" src="https://grep.be/blog//smileys/smile.png" /></p>

At work, I help maintain a [smartcard][1] [middleware][2] that is provided to
Belgian citizens who want to use their electronic ID card to, e.g., log on to
government websites. This middleware is a piece of software that hooks into
various browsers and adds a way to access the smartcard in question, through
whatever APIs the operating system and the browser in question provide for
that purpose. The details of how that is done differ between each browser (and
in the case of Google Chrome, for the same browser between different operating
systems); but for Firefox (and Google Chrome on free operating systems), this
is done by way of a [PKCS#11][3] module.

   [1]: <https://eid.belgium.be>
   [2]: <https://github.com/Fedict/eid-mw>
   [3]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11>

For Firefox 57, mozilla decided to overhaul much of their browser. The changes
are large and massive, and in some ways revolutionary. It's no surprise,
therefore, that some of the changes break compatibility with older things.

One of the areas in which breaking changes were made is in the area of
extensions to the browser. Previously, Firefox had various APIs available for
extensions; right now, all APIs apart from the WebExtensions API are
considered "legacy" and support for them will be removed from Firefox 57 going
forward.

Since installing a PKCS#11 module manually is a bit complicated, and since the
legacy APIs provided a way to do so automatically provided the user would
first install an add-on (or provided the installer of the PKCS#11 module
sideloads it), most parties who provide a PKCS#11 module for use with Firefox
will provide an add-on to automatically install it. Since the alternative
involves entering the right values in a dialog box that's hidden away
somewhere deep in the preferences screen, the add-on option is much more user
friendly.

I'm sure you can imagine my dismay when I found out that there was no
WebExtensions API to provide the same functionality. So, after asking around a
bit, I filed [bug 1357391][4] to get a discussion started. While it took some
convincing initially to get people to understand the reasons for wanting such
an API, eventually the bug was assigned the "P5" priority -- essentially, a
"we understand the need and won't block it, but we don't have the time to
implement it. Patches welcome, though" statement.

<img src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/skx.png" width="76" height="105" alt="" align="right" style="float: right;">  <p>So my last blog-post was about creating a digital-radio, powered by an ESP8266 device, there's a joke there about wireless-control of a wireless.  I'm not going to make it.</p>

<p>Sticking with a theme <em>this</em> post is also about radio, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio">software-defined radio</a>.  I know almost nothing about SDR, except that it can be used to let your computer "do stuff" with radio.  The only application I've ever read about that seemed interesting was tracking aircraft.</p>

<p>This post is about setting up a Debian GNU/Linux system to do exactly that, show aircraft in real-time above your head!  This was almost painless to setup.</p>

<ul>
<li>Buy the hardware.</li>
<li>Plug in the hardware.</li>
<li>Confirm it is detected.</li>
<li>Install the appropriate sdr development-package(s).</li>
<li>Install the magic software.
<ul>
<li>Written by @antirez, no less, you know it is gonna be good!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So I bought <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Sale-USB-2-0-Software-Radio-DVB-T-RTL2832U-R820T2-SDR-Digital-TV-Receiver-Stick/32815560547.html">this USB device</a> from AliExpress for the grand total of €8.46.  I have no idea if that URL is stable, but I suspect it is probably not.  Good luck finding something similar if you're living in the future!</p>

<p>Once I connected the Antenna to the USB stick, and inserted it into a spare slot it showed up in the output of <code>lsusb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>  $ lsusb
  ..
  Bus 003 Device 043: ID 0bda:2838 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL2838 DVB-T

<p>In more detail I see the major/minor numbers:</p>

<pre><code>  idVendor           0x0bda Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
  idProduct          0x2838 RTL2838 DVB-T
</code></pre>

<p>So far, so good. I installed the development headers/library I needed:</p>

<pre><code>  # apt-get install librtlsdr-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Once that was done I could clone antirez's repository, and build it:</p>

<pre><code>  $ git clone https://github.com/antirez/dump1090.git
  $ cd dump1090
  $ make
</code></pre>

<p>And run it:</p>

<pre><code>  $ sudo ./dump1090 --interactive --net
</code></pre>

<p>This failed initially as a kernel-module had claimed the device, but removing that was trivial:</p>

<pre><code>  $ sudo rmmod dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
  $ sudo ./dump1090 --interactive --net
</code></pre>

<p>Once it was running I'd see live updates on the console, every second:</p>

Sticking with a theme _this_ post is also about radio, [software-defined

This post is about setting up a Debian GNU/Linux system to do exactly that,

  * Confirm it is detected.
  * Install the appropriate sdr development-package(s).

So I bought [this USB device][2] from AliExpress for the grand total of €8.46.

[RProtoBuf][1] provides [R][2] bindings for the [Google Protocol Buffers
("ProtoBuf")][3] data encoding and serialization library used and released by
Google, and deployed fairly widely in numerous projects as a language and
operating-system agnostic protocol.

A new releases [RProtoBuf 0.4.11][4] appeared on CRAN earlier today. Not
unlike the other recent releases, it is mostly a maintenance release which
switches two of the vignettes over to using the [pinp][5] package and its
template for vignettes.

[CRANberries][6] also provides a [diff to the previous release][7]. The
[RProtoBuf][8] page has copies of the [(older) package vignette][9], the
['quick' overview vignette][10], a [unit test summary vignette][11], and the
[pre-print for the JSS paper][12]. Questions, comments etc should go to the

Some things I don't really understand reading in German media

  * Suddenly the electoral system becomes a legitimacy problem. While it has never been a problem for any of the previous decisions of the Catalunyan regional government suddenly a ["only 48% of people voted for the government"][1] results in the decisions being illegitimate? This is also a property of many governments ([Greece][2] and the [US president][3] being obvious examples but also the [German Bundestag][4] can have a majority government without the majority of votes). Is this just the media trying to find something they can blame on "the other side"?
