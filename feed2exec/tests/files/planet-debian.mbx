http://perezmeyer.blogspot.com/2017/10/qt-4-and-5-and-oepnssl10-removal.html

Today we received updates on the OpenSSL 1.0 removal status:  
  
<<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=828522#206>>  
<<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=859671#19>>  
  
So those removal bugs' severities will be raised to RC in aproximately a
month.  
  
We still don't have any solutions for Qt 4 or 5.  
  
For the Qt 5 case we will probably keep the bug open until Qt 5.10 is in the
archive which should bring OpenSSL 1.1 support ***or*** FTP masters decide to
remove OpenSSL1.0. In this last case the fate will be the same as with Qt4,
below.  
  
For Qt4 we do not have patches available and there will probably be none in
time (remember we do not have upstream support). That plus the fact that we
are actively trying to remove it from the archive it means we will remove
openssl support. This might mean that apps using Qt4:  
  
\- Might cease to work.  
\- Might keep working:  
\- Informing their users that no SSL support is available → programmer did a
good job.  
\- Not informing their users that no SSL support is available and establishing
connections non the less → programmer might have not done a good job.  
  
Trying to inform users as soon as possible,

In order to easily authenticate with IRC networks such as [OFTC][1] and
[Freenode][2], it is possible to use _client TLS certificates_ (also known as
_SSL certificates_ ). In fact, it turns out that it's very easy to setup both
on [irssi][3] and on [znc][4].

   [2]: <https://freenode.net/kb/answer/certfp>
   [3]: <https://irssi.org/>
   [4]: <https://wiki.znc.in/>

# Generate your TLS certificate

On a machine with [good entropy][5], run the following command to create a
keypair that will last for 10 years:

    
       [5]: <http://altusmetrum.org/ChaosKey/>

    openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout user.pem -x509 -days 3650 -out user.pem -subj "/CN=<your nick>"
    

Then extract your key fingerprint using this command:

    
    
    openssl x509 -sha1 -noout -fingerprint -in user.pem | sed -e 's/^.*=//;s/://g'
    

# Share your fingerprints with NickServ

On each IRC network, do this:

    
    
    /msg NickServ IDENTIFY Password1!
    /msg NickServ CERT ADD <your fingerprint>
    

in order to add your fingerprint to the access control list.

# Configure ZNC

To configure znc, start by putting the key in the right place:

    
    
    cp user.pem ~/.znc/users/<your nick>/networks/oftc/moddata/cert/
    

and then enable the built-in [cert plugin][6] for each network in
`~/.znc/configs/znc.conf`:

    
       [6]: <https://wiki.znc.in/Cert>

    <Network oftc>
        ...
                LoadModule = cert
        ...
    </Network>
        <Network freenode>
        ...
                LoadModule = cert
        ...
    </Network>
    

# Configure irssi

For irssi, do the same thing but put the cert in `~/.irssi/user.pem` and then
change the OFTC entry in `~/.irssi/config` to look like this:

    
    
    {
      address = "irc.oftc.net";
      chatnet = "OFTC";
      port = "6697";
      use_tls = "yes";
      tls_cert = "~/.irssi/user.pem";
      tls_verify = "yes";
      autoconnect = "yes";
    }
    

and the Freenode one to look like this:

    
    
    {
      address = "chat.freenode.net";
      chatnet = "Freenode";
      port = "7000";
      use_tls = "yes";
      tls_cert = "~/.irssi/user.pem";
      tls_verify = "yes";
      autoconnect = "yes";
    }
    

That's it. That's all you need to replace password authentication with a much
stronger alternative.

<img align="right" alt="" height="84" src="http://planet.debian.org/heads/kees.png" style="float: right;" width="92" />  <p>Previously: <a href="http://outflux.net/blog/archives/2017/07/10/security-things-in-linux-v4-12/">v4.12</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a short summary of some of interesting security things in Sunday’s v4.13 release of the Linux kernel:</p>
<p><strong>security documentation ReSTification</strong><br />
The kernel has been switching to formatting documentation with <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/doc-guide/sphinx.html">ReST</a>, and I noticed that none of the <code>Documentation/security/</code> tree had been converted yet. I <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c2ed6743434d1d9ef49b044c6bdfd6ac1ce140a2">took the opportunity</a> to take a few passes at formatting the existing documentation and, at Jon Corbet’s recommendation, split it up between <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/LSM/index.html">end-user documentation</a> (which is mainly how to use LSMs) and <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/security/index.html">developer documentation</a> (which is mainly how to use various internal APIs). A bunch of these docs need some updating, so maybe with the improved visibility, they’ll get some extra attention.</p>
<p><strong>CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL</strong><br />
Since Peter Zijlstra implemented the <a href="http://outflux.net/blog/archives/2017/05/02/security-things-in-linux-v4-11/"><code>refcount_t</code> API</a> in v4.11, Elena Reshetova (with Hans Liljestrand and David Windsor) has been systematically replacing <code>atomic_t</code> reference counters with <code>refcount_t</code>. As of v4.13, there are now <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?h=v4.13&amp;qt=grep&amp;q=refcount_t">close to 125 conversions</a> with many more to come. However, there were concerns over the performance characteristics of the <code>refcount_t</code> implementation from the maintainers of the net, mm, and block subsystems. In order to assuage these concerns and help the conversion progress continue, I added an “unchecked” <code>refcount_t</code> implementation (identical to the earlier <code>atomic_t</code> implementation) as the default, with the fully checked implementation now available under <code>CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL</code>. The plan is that for v4.14 and beyond, the kernel can grow <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git/commit/?id=7a46ec0e2f4850407de5e1d19a44edee6efa58ec">per-architecture implementations of <code>refcount_t</code></a> that have performance characteristics on par with <code>atomic_t</code> (as done in grsecurity’s PAX_REFCOUNT).</p>
<p><strong>CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE</strong><br />
Daniel Micay <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6974f0c4555e285ab217cee58b6e874f776ff409">created a version</a> of glibc’s <code>FORTIFY_SOURCE</code> compile-time and run-time protection for finding overflows in the common string (e.g. <code>strcpy</code>, <code>strcmp</code>) and memory (e.g. <code>memcpy</code>, <code>memcmp</code>) functions. The idea is that since the compiler already knows the size of many of the buffer arguments used by these functions, it can already build in checks for buffer overflows. When all the sizes are known at compile time, this can actually allow the compiler to fail the build instead of continuing with a proven overflow. When only some of the sizes are known (e.g. destination size is known at compile-time, but source size is only known at run-time) run-time checks are added to catch any cases where an overflow might happen. Adding this <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4c93496f18ce5044d78e4f7f9e018682a4f44b3d">found</a> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e2ae8ab4b571e2e4094a28acb60649bc2732c67f">several</a> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/3e2c044a54e6b6373606f8ffad42a4a0759fcf3d">places</a> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c0944883c97c0ddc71da67cc731590a7c878a1a2">where</a> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/42c335f7e67029d2e01711f2f2bc6252277c8993">minor</a> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/dbbb08f500d6146398b794fdc68a8e811366b451">leaks</a> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/12e3c0433e8a3b817fbb978a1be973a04cd5d6f3">were</a> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/e48d661eb13f2f83861428f001c567fdb3f317e8">happening</a>, and Daniel and I chased down fixes for them.</p>
<p>One interesting note about this protection is that is only examines the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Object-Size-Checking.html">size of the whole object</a> for its size (via <code>__builtin_object_size(..., <strong>0</strong>)</code>). If you have a string within a structure, <code>CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE</code> as currently implemented will make sure only that you can’t copy beyond the structure (but therefore, you <em>can</em> still overflow the string within the structure). The next step in enhancing this protection is to switch from 0 (above) to 1, which will use the closest surrounding subobject (e.g. the string). However, there are a lot of cases where the kernel intentionally copies across multiple structure fields, which means more fixes before this higher level can be enabled.</p>
<p><strong>NULL-prefixed stack canary</strong><br />
Rik van Riel and Daniel Micay changed how the stack canary is defined on 64-bit systems to always make sure that the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/022c204040f3fd22d6445bc35517786195b7ae80">leading byte is zero</a>. This provides a deterministic defense against overflowing string functions (e.g. <code>strcpy</code>), since they will either stop an overflowing read at the NULL byte, or be unable to write a NULL byte, thereby always triggering the canary check. This does reduce the entropy from 64 bits to 56 bits for overflow cases where NULL bytes can be written (e.g. <code>memcpy</code>), but the trade-off is worth it. (Besdies, x86_64’s canary was 32-bits <a href="http://outflux.net/blog/archives/2017/07/10/security-things-in-linux-v4-12/">until recently</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>IPC refactoring</strong><br />
Partially in support of allowing IPC structure layouts to be randomized by the randstruct plugin, Manfred Spraul and I reorganized the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/1a23395672658969a4035dcc518ea6cab835c579">internal layout</a> of how IPC is tracked in the kernel. The resulting allocations are smaller and much easier to deal with, even if I initially missed a <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ade9f91b32b964e83d294f4973d50083b08ef6fc">few needed container_of() uses</a>.</p>
<p><strong>randstruct gcc plugin</strong><br />
I ported grsecurity’s clever <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/313dd1b629219db50cad532dba6a3b3b22ffe622">randstruct gcc plugin to upstream</a>. This plugin allows structure layouts to be randomized on a per-build basis, providing a probabilistic defense against attacks that need to know the location of sensitive structure fields in kernel memory (which is most attacks). By moving things around in this fashion, attackers need to perform much more work to determine the resulting layout before they can mount a reliable attack.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the timing of the development cycle, only the “manual” mode of randstruct landed in upstream (i.e. <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/3859a271a003aba01e45b85c9d8b355eb7bf25f9">marking structures with <code>__randomize_layout</code></a>). v4.14 will also have the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kees/linux.git/commit/?id=9225331b310821760f39ba55b00b8973602adbb5">automatic mode enabled</a>, which randomizes all structures that contain only function pointers.</p>
<p>A large number of fixes to support randstruct have been landing from <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?h=v4.13&amp;qt=grep&amp;q=designated+init">v4.10 through v4.13</a>, most of which were already identified and fixed by grsecurity, but many were novel, either in newly added drivers, as <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/1854c19cae0d108637c40f90ee0bb9b7c1adbc0a">whitelisted cross-structure casts</a>, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/3e2e857f9c3a19d55ee0ba7b428b8be5008960bf">refactorings</a> (like IPC noted above), or in a <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ffa47aa678cfaa9b88e8a26cfb115b4768325121">corner case on ARM</a> found during upstream testing.</p>
<p><strong>lower ELF_ET_DYN_BASE</strong><br />
One of the issues identified from the <a href="https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2017/06/19/the-stack-clash">Stack Clash</a> set of vulnerabilities was that it was possible to collide stack memory with the highest portion of a PIE program’s text memory since the default <code>ELF_ET_DYN_BASE</code> (the lowest possible random position of a PIE executable in memory) was already so high in the memory layout (specifically, 2/3rds of the way through the address space). Fixing this required <a href="http://git.kernel.org/linus/eab09532d40090698b05a07c1c87f39fdbc5fab5">teaching the ELF loader</a> how to load interpreters as shared objects in the mmap region instead of as a PIE executable (to avoid potentially colliding with the binary it was loading). As a result, the PIE default could be moved down to ET_EXEC (0x400000) on 32-bit, entirely avoiding the subset of Stack Clash attacks. 64-bit could be moved to just above the 32-bit address space (0x100000000), leaving the entire 32-bit region open for VMs to do 32-bit addressing, but late in the cycle it was discovered that <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/c715b72c1ba406f133217b509044c38d8e714a37">Address Sanitizer couldn’t handle it moving</a>. With most of the Stack Clash risk only applicable to 32-bit, fixing 64-bit has been deferred until there is a way to teach Address Sanitizer how to load itself as a shared object instead of as a PIE binary.</p>
<p><strong>early device randomness</strong><br />
I noticed that early device randomness wasn’t actually getting added to the kernel entropy pools, so I <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ee7998c50c2697737c6530431709f77c852bf0d6">fixed that</a> to improve the effectiveness of the latent_entropy gcc plugin.</p>
<p>That’s it for now; please let me know if I missed anything. As a side note, I was rather alarmed to discover that due to all my trivial ReSTification formatting, and tiny FORTIFY_SOURCE and randstruct fixes, I made it into the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/731794/">most active 4.13 developers</a> list (by patch count) at LWN with 76 patches: a whopping 0.6% of the cycle’s patches. ;)</p>
<p>Anyway, the v4.14 merge window is open!</p>

**CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL**  
Since Peter Zijlstra implemented the [`refcount_t` API][6] in v4.11, Elena
Reshetova (with Hans Liljestrand and David Windsor) has been systematically
replacing `atomic_t` reference counters with `refcount_t`. As of v4.13, there
are now [close to 125 conversions][7] with many more to come. However, there
were concerns over the performance characteristics of the `refcount_t`
implementation from the maintainers of the net, mm, and block subsystems. In
order to assuage these concerns and help the conversion progress continue, I
added an “unchecked” `refcount_t` implementation (identical to the earlier
`atomic_t` implementation) as the default, with the fully checked
implementation now available under `CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL`. The plan is that
for v4.14 and beyond, the kernel can grow [per-architecture implementations of
`refcount_t`][8] that have performance characteristics on par with `atomic_t`
(as done in grsecurity’s PAX_REFCOUNT).

**CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE**  
Daniel Micay [created a version][9] of glibc’s `FORTIFY_SOURCE` compile-time
and run-time protection for finding overflows in the common string (e.g.
`strcpy`, `strcmp`) and memory (e.g. `memcpy`, `memcmp`) functions. The idea
is that since the compiler already knows the size of many of the buffer
arguments used by these functions, it can already build in checks for buffer
overflows. When all the sizes are known at compile time, this can actually
allow the compiler to fail the build instead of continuing with a proven
overflow. When only some of the sizes are known (e.g. destination size is
known at compile-time, but source size is only known at run-time) run-time
checks are added to catch any cases where an overflow might happen. Adding
this [found][10] [several][11] [places][12] [where][13] [minor][14]
[leaks][15] [were][16] [happening][17], and Daniel and I chased down fixes for
them.

One interesting note about this protection is that is only examines the [size
of the whole object][18] for its size (via `__builtin_object_size(..., **0**
)`). If you have a string within a structure, `CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE` as
currently implemented will make sure only that you can’t copy beyond the
structure (but therefore, you _can_ still overflow the string within the
structure). The next step in enhancing this protection is to switch from 0
(above) to 1, which will use the closest surrounding subobject (e.g. the
string). However, there are a lot of cases where the kernel intentionally
copies across multiple structure fields, which means more fixes before this
higher level can be enabled.

   [18]: <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Object-Size-Checking.html>

**NULL-prefixed stack canary**  
Rik van Riel and Daniel Micay changed how the stack canary is defined on
64-bit systems to always make sure that the [leading byte is zero][19]. This
provides a deterministic defense against overflowing string functions (e.g.
`strcpy`), since they will either stop an overflowing read at the NULL byte,
or be unable to write a NULL byte, thereby always triggering the canary check.
This does reduce the entropy from 64 bits to 56 bits for overflow cases where
NULL bytes can be written (e.g. `memcpy`), but the trade-off is worth it.
(Besdies, x86_64’s canary was 32-bits [until recently][20].)

**IPC refactoring**  
Partially in support of allowing IPC structure layouts to be randomized by the
randstruct plugin, Manfred Spraul and I reorganized the [internal layout][21]
of how IPC is tracked in the kernel. The resulting allocations are smaller and
much easier to deal with, even if I initially missed a [few needed
container_of() uses][22].

   [21]: <https://git.kernel.org/linus/1a23395672658969a4035dcc518ea6cab835c579>
   [22]: <https://git.kernel.org/linus/ade9f91b32b964e83d294f4973d50083b08ef6fc>

**randstruct gcc plugin**  
I ported grsecurity’s clever [randstruct gcc plugin to upstream][23]. This
plugin allows structure layouts to be randomized on a per-build basis,
providing a probabilistic defense against attacks that need to know the
location of sensitive structure fields in kernel memory (which is most
attacks). By moving things around in this fashion, attackers need to perform
much more work to determine the resulting layout before they can mount a
reliable attack.

   [23]: <https://git.kernel.org/linus/313dd1b629219db50cad532dba6a3b3b22ffe622>

Unfortunately, due to the timing of the development cycle, only the “manual”
mode of randstruct landed in upstream (i.e. [marking structures with
`__randomize_layout`][24]). v4.14 will also have the [automatic mode
enabled][25], which randomizes all structures that contain only function
pointers.

   [24]: <https://git.kernel.org/linus/3859a271a003aba01e45b85c9d8b355eb7bf25f9>

A large number of fixes to support randstruct have been landing from [v4.10 through v4.13][26], most of which were already identified and fixed by grsecurity, but many were novel, either in newly added drivers, as [whitelisted cross-structure casts][27], [refactorings][28] (like IPC noted above), or in a [corner case on ARM][29] found during upstream testing.

**lower ELF_ET_DYN_BASE**  
One of the issues identified from the [Stack Clash][30] set of vulnerabilities
was that it was possible to collide stack memory with the highest portion of a
PIE program’s text memory since the default `ELF_ET_DYN_BASE` (the lowest
possible random position of a PIE executable in memory) was already so high in
the memory layout (specifically, 2/3rds of the way through the address space).
Fixing this required [teaching the ELF loader][31] how to load interpreters as
shared objects in the mmap region instead of as a PIE executable (to avoid
potentially colliding with the binary it was loading). As a result, the PIE
default could be moved down to ET_EXEC (0x400000) on 32-bit, entirely avoiding
the subset of Stack Clash attacks. 64-bit could be moved to just above the
32-bit address space (0x100000000), leaving the entire 32-bit region open for
VMs to do 32-bit addressing, but late in the cycle it was discovered that
[Address Sanitizer couldn’t handle it moving][32]. With most of the Stack
Clash risk only applicable to 32-bit, fixing 64-bit has been deferred until
there is a way to teach Address Sanitizer how to load itself as a shared
object instead of as a PIE binary.

   [32]: <https://git.kernel.org/linus/c715b72c1ba406f133217b509044c38d8e714a37>

**early device randomness**  
I noticed that early device randomness wasn’t actually getting added to the
kernel entropy pools, so I [fixed that][33] to improve the effectiveness of
the latent_entropy gcc plugin.

   [33]: <https://git.kernel.org/linus/ee7998c50c2697737c6530431709f77c852bf0d6>

That’s it for now; please let me know if I missed anything. As a side note, I
was rather alarmed to discover that due to all my trivial ReSTification
formatting, and tiny FORTIFY_SOURCE and randstruct fixes, I made it into the
[most active 4.13 developers][34] list (by patch count) at LWN with 76
patches: a whopping 0.6% of the cycle’s patches. ;)

   [34]: <https://lwn.net/Articles/731794/>

Anyway, the v4.14 merge window is open!

<h1 id="debian-long-term-support-lts">Debian Long Term Support (LTS)</h1>

<p>This is my monthly <a href="https://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html">Debian LTS</a> report. This month I worked on a few
major packages that took a long time instead of multiple smaller
issues. Affected packages were Mercurial, libdbd-mysql-perl and Ruby.</p>

<h2 id="mercurial-updates">Mercurial updates</h2>

<p>Mercurial was vulnerable to two CVEs: <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-1000116">CVE-2017-1000116</a>
(command injection on clients through malicious ssh URLs) and
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-1000115">CVE-2017-1000115</a> (path traversal via symlink). The former
is an issue that actually affects many other similar software like Git
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-1000117">CVE-2017-1000117</a>), Subversion (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-9800">CVE-2017-9800</a>)
and even CVS (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-12836">CVE-2017-12836</a>). The latter symlink issue is
a distinct issue that came up during an internal audit.</p>

<p>The fix, shipped as <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2017/08/msg00032.html">DLA-1072-1</a>, involved a rather difficult
backport, especially because the Mercurial test suite takes a long
time to complete. This reminded me of the virtues of
<code>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=4</code>, which sped up the builds
considerably. I also discovered that the Wheezy build chain doesn't
support <a href="http://manpages.debian.org/sbuild">sbuild</a>'s <code>--source-only-changes</code> flag which I had
hardcoded in my <a href="http://manpages.debian.org/sbuild%2Econf">sbuild.conf</a> file. This seems to be simply
because sbuild passes <code>--build=source</code> to <a href="http://manpages.debian.org/dpkg%2Dbuildpackage">dpkg-buildpackage</a>, an option that is supported only in jessie or
later.</p>

<h2 id="libdbd-mysql-perl">libdbd-mysql-perl</h2>

<p>I have worked on fixing two issues with the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/libdbd%2Dmysql%2Dperl">libdbd-mysql-perl</a> package, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-10788">CVE-2017-10788</a> and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-10789">CVE-2017-10789</a>, which resulted in the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/20170831115827.eaciz7h6g7ecl5jh@curie.anarc.at">DLA-1079-1</a> upload.
Behind this mysteriously named package sits a critical piece of
infrastructure, namely the <code>mysql</code> commandline client which is
probably used and abused by hundreds if not thousands of home-made
scripts, but also all of Perl's MySQL support, which is probably used
by even a larger base of software.</p>

<p>Through the Debian bug reports (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/866818">Debian bug #866818</a> and <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/866821">Debian bug #866821</a>), I have learned that the patches existed in the upstream
tracker but were either <a href="https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-mysql/issues/120#issuecomment-325342844">ignored</a> or even <a href="https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-mysql/issues/110">reverted</a> in the
latest 4.043 upstream release. It turns out that there are talks of
<a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.dbi.dev/2017/08/msg8030.html">forking that library</a> because of maintainership issue. It blows my
mind that such an important part of MySQL is basically unmaintained.</p>

<p>I ended up backporting the upstream patches, which was also somewhat
difficult because of the long-standing issues with SSL support in
MySQL. The backport there was particularly hard to test, as you need
to run that test suite by hand, twice: once with a server configured
with a (valid!) SSL certificate and one without (!). I'm wondering how
much time it is really worth spending on trying to fix SSL in MySQL,
however. It has been badly broken forever, and while the patch <em>is</em> an
improvement, I would actually still never trust SSL transports in
MySQL over an untrusted network. The few people that I know use such
transports wrap their connections around a simpler <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stunnel">stunnel</a>
instead.</p>

<p>The other issue was easier to fix so I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-mysql/pull/142">pull request
upstream</a> to make sure that work isn't lost, although it is not
clear what the future of that patch (or project!) will be at this
point.</p>

<h2 id="rubygems">Rubygems</h2>

<p>I also worked on the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/rubygems">rubygems</a> issues, which, thanks to the
"vendoring" practice of the Ruby community, also affects the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/ruby1%2E9">ruby1.9</a> package. 4 distinct CVEs were triaged here (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-0899">CVE-2017-0899</a>, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-0900">CVE-2017-0900</a>, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-0901">CVE-2017-0901</a>
and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-0902">CVE-2017-0902</a>) and I determined the latter issue
didn't affect wheezy as rubygems doesn't do its own DNS resolution
there (later versions lookup SRV records).</p>

<p>This is another package where the test suite takes a long time to
run. Worse, the packages in Wheezy actually fails to build from
source: the test suites just fail in various steps, particularly
because of <code>dh key too small</code> errors for Rubygems, but also other
errors for Ruby. I also had trouble backporting one test which I had
to simply skip for Rubygems. I uploaded and <a href="https://lists.debian.org/87h8wkzyos.fsf@curie.anarc.at">announced</a> test
packages and hopefully I'll be able to complete this work soon,
although I would certainly appreciate any help on this...</p>

<h2 id="triage">Triage</h2>

<p>I took a look at the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sox">sox</a>, <a href="http://packages.debian.org/libvorbis">libvorbis</a> and
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/exiv2">exiv2</a> issues. None had fixes available. sox and exiv2 were
basically a list of fuzzing issues, which are often minor or at least
of unknown severity. Those would have required a significant amount of
work and I figured I would prioritize other work first.</p>

<p>I also triaged <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-7506">CVE-2017-7506</a>, which doesn't seem to affect
the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/spice">spice</a> package in wheezy, after doing a fairly thorough
audit of the code. The vulnerability is specifically bound to the
<code>reds_on_main_agent_monitors_config</code> function, which is simply not
present in our older version. A hostile message would fall through the
code and not provoke memory allocation or out of bounds access, so I
simply marked the wheezy version as <code>not-affected</code>, something which
usually happens during the original triage but can also happen during
the actual patching work, as in this case.</p>

<h1 id="other-free-software-work">Other free software work</h1>

<p>This describes the volunteer work I do on various free software
projects. This month, again, my internal reports show that I spent
about the same time on volunteer and paid time, but this is probably a
wrong estimate because I spent a lot of time at Debconf which I didn't
clock in...</p>

<h2 id="debconf">Debconf</h2>

<p>So I participated in the <a href="http://debconf17.debconf.org/">17th Debian Conference</a> in Montreal. It
was great to see (and make!) so many friends from all over the world
in person again, and I was happy to work on specific issues together
with other Debian developers. I am especially thankful to David
Bremner for fixing the syncing of the <code>flagged</code> tag when added to new
messages (<a href="https://notmuchmail.org/pipermail/notmuch/2017/025046.html">patch series</a>). This allows me to easily sync the one
tag (<code>inbox</code>) that is not statically assigned during <code>notmuch new</code>, by
using <code>flagged</code> as a synchronization tool. This allows me to use
notmuch more easily across multiple machines without having to sync
all tags with dump/restore or using muchsync which wasn't working for
me (although a <a href="https://notmuchmail.org/pipermail/notmuch/2017/024500.html">new release came out</a> which may fix my issues). The
magic incantation looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>notmuch tag -inbox tag:inbox and not tag:flagged
notmuch tag +inbox not tag:inbox and tag:flagged
</code></pre>

<p>However, most of my time in the first week (Debcamp) was spent trying
to complete the networking setup: configure switches, setup wiring and
so on. I also configured an <a href="http://packages.debian.org/apt%2Dcacher%2Dng">apt-cacher-ng</a> proxy to serve
packages to attendees during the conference. I configured it with
Avahi to configure clients automatically, which led me to discover
(and fix) issue <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/870321">Debian bug #870321</a>) although there are more issues
with the autodiscovery mechanism... I spent extra time to document the
(somewhat simple) configuration of such a server in the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/AptCacherNg">Debian
wiki</a> because it was not the first time I had research that
procedure...</p>

<p>I somehow thought this was a great time to upgrade my laptop to
stretch. Normally, I keep that device running stable because I don't
use it often and I don't want to have major traumatizing upgrades
every time I leave with it on a trip. But this time was special: there
were literally <em>hundreds</em> of Debian developers to help me out if there
was trouble. And there was, of course, trouble as it turns out! I had
problems with the fonts on my display, because, well, I had
<em>suspended</em> (twice) my laptop <em>during</em> the install. The fix was simply
to flush the fontconfig cache, and I tried to document this in the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Fonts">fonts wiki page</a> and my <a href="http://anarc.at/services/upgrades/stretch/">upgrades page</a>.</p>

<p>I also gave a short training called <a href="https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/161/">Debian packaging 101</a> which
was pretty successful. Like the short presentation I made at the last
<a href="http://anarc.at/blog/2017-04-09-montreal-bsp-report/">Montreal BSP</a>, the workshop was
based on my <a href="http://anarc.at/software/debian-development/">quick debian development guide</a>. 
I'm thinking of expanding this to a larger audience with a "102"
course that would discuss more complex packaging problems. But my
secret plan (well, secret until now I guess) is to make packaging
procedures more uniform in Debian by training new Debian packagers
using that same training for the next 2 decades. But I will probably
start by just trying to do this again at the next Debconf, if I can
attend.</p>

<h2 id="debian-uploads">Debian uploads</h2>

<p>I also sponsored two packages during Debconf: one was a "scratch an
itch" upload (<a href="http://packages.debian.org/elpa%2Divy">elpa-ivy</a>) which I requested (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/863216">Debian bug #863216</a>) as part of a larger effort to ship the Emacs elisp packages
as Debian packages. The other was an <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/864378">upload</a> of <a href="http://packages.debian.org/diceware">diceware</a> to build the documentation in a separate package and fix
other issues I have found in the package during a review.</p>

<p>I also uploaded a bunch of other fixes to the Debian archive:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/slop">slop</a> upstream update and matching <a href="http://packages.debian.org/maim">maim</a> NMU</li>
<li>asked for <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gnome%2Dweb%2Dphoto">gnome-web-photo</a> removal (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/873015">Debian bug #873015</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/charybdis">charybdis</a> 3.5.5-2 to officially switch to <a href="http://packages.debian.org/mbedtls">mbedtls</a> (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/705369">Debian bug #705369</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/gmpc">gmpc</a>: ship pending patches from git and Ubuntu</li>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/horst">horst</a>: new upstream release and workaround for sparse
bug <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/873508">Debian bug #873508</a></li>
<li>uploaded <a href="https://github.com/mooz/percol">percol</a> to NEW (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/754972">Debian bug #754972</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="signing-keys-rotation">Signing keys rotation</h2>

<p>I also started the process of moving my main OpenPGP certification key
by adding a signing subkey. The subkey is stored in a cryptographic
token so I can sign things on more than one machine without storing
that critical key on all those devices physically.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this meant that I need to do some shenanigans when I
want to sign content in my Debian work, because the new subkey takes
time to propagate to the Debian archive. For example, I have to
specify the primary key with a "bang" when signing packages (<code>debsign
-k '792152527B75921E!' ...</code>) or use inline signatures in email sent
for security announcement (since that trick doesn't work in Mutt <em>or</em>
Notmuch). I tried to figure out how to better coordinate this next
time by reading up documentation on <a href="https://keyring.debian.org/">keyring.debian.org</a>, but there
is no fixed date for key changes on the rsync interface. There are
"monthly changes" so one's best bet is to look for the last change in
their git repository.</p>

<h2 id="gitlabcom-and-lfs-migration">GitLab.com and LFS migration</h2>

<p>I finally turned off my <a href="http://src.anarc.at/">src.anarc.at</a> git repository service by
moving the remaining repos to <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>. Unfortunately, GitLab
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1648">removed support for git-annex</a> recently, so I had to migrate my
repositories to Git-LFS, which was an interesting experience. LFS is
pretty easy to use, definitely simpler than git-annex. It also seems
to be a good match for the use-case at hand, which is to store large
files (videos, namely) as part of slides for presentations.</p>

<p>It turns out that their migration guide could have been made much
simpler. I tried to submit those changes to the documentation but
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3287">couldn't fork the GitLab EE project</a> to make a patch, so I just
documented the issue in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/1230#note_38813881">the original MR</a> for now. While I was
there I filed a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/37242">feature request</a> to add a new reference shortcut
(<code>GL-NNN</code>) after noticing a similar token <a href="https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode/commit/b163f104d83fd3eeb909920284c981e8fba1b481">used on GitHub</a>. This
would be a useful addition because I often have numbering conflicts
between Debian BTS bug numbers and GitLab issues in packages I
maintain there. In particular, I have problems using GitLab issue
numbers in Monkeysign, because commit logs end up in Debian changelogs
and will be detected by the Debian infrastructure even though those
are GitLab bug numbers. Using such a shortcut would avoid detection
and such a conflict.</p>

<h2 id="numpy-stats">Numpy-stats</h2>

<p>I wrote a small tool to extract numeric statistics from a given
file. I often do ad-hoc benchmarks where I store a bunch of numbers in
a file and then try to make averages and so on. As an exercise in
learning <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, I figured I would write such a simple tool,
called <a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/scripts/blob/master/numpy-stats">numpy-stats</a>, which probably sounds naive to seasoned
Python scientists.</p>

<p>My incentive was that I was trying to figure out what was the
distribution of password length in a given <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/237228/command-line-tool-to-generate-memorable-passwords/1246245#comment1828733_1052689">password generator
scheme</a>. So I wrote this simple script:</p>

<pre><code>for i in seq 10000 ; do
    shuf -n4 /usr/share/dict/words | tr -d '\n'
done &gt; length
</code></pre>

<p>And then feed that data in the tool:</p>

<pre><code>$ numpy-stats lengths 
{
  "max": 60, 
  "mean": 33.883293722913464, 
  "median": 34.0, 
  "min": 14, 
  "size": 143060, 
  "std": 5.101490225062775
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am surprised that there isn't such a tool already: hopefully I am
wrong and will just be pointed towards the better alternative in the
comments here!</p>

<h2 id="safe-eyes">Safe Eyes</h2>

<p>I added <a href="https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes/commit/6a8b29a87baa53aca2ccc3e280079d04c2b2bf39">screensaver support</a> to the new <a href="https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes/">SafeEyes</a> project,
which I am considering as a replacement to the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/workrave">workrave</a>
project I have been using for years. I really like how the
interruptions basically block the whole screen: way more effective
than only blocking the keyboard, because all potential distractions go
away.</p>

<p>One feature that is missing is <a href="https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes/issues/184">keystrokes and mouse movement
counting</a> and of course an <a href="https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes/issues/183">official Debian package</a>, although
the latter would be easy to fix because upstream already has an
unofficial build. I am thinking of writing my own little tool to count
keystrokes, since the overlap between SafeEyes and such a counter
isn't absolutely necessary. This is something that workrave does, but
there are "idle time" extensions in Xorg that do not <em>need</em> to count
keystrokes. There are already certain tools to count input events, but
none seem to do what I want (most of them are basically
keyloggers). It would be an interesting test to see if it's possible
to write something that would work both for Xorg and Wayland at the
same time. Unfortunately, preliminary research show that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>in Xorg, the only way to implement this is to sniff all events,
ie. to implement a keylogger</p></li>
<li><p>in Wayland, this is <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1032270/wayland-alternative-for-xorgs-xdotool">completely unsupported</a>. it seems <em>some</em>
compositors <em>could</em> implement such a counter, but then it means
that this is compositor specific, or, in other words, unportable</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So there is little hope here, which brings to my mind "painmeter" as
an appropriate name for this future programming nightmare.</p>

<h2 id="ansible">Ansible</h2>

<p>I sent my first contribution to the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/ansible">ansible</a> project with a
small <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/28766">documentation fix</a>. I had an eye opener recently when I
discovered a <a href="https://gist.github.com/kpcyrd/1bde93b2bb9c77e0b6c14a2b3f75b026">GitLab ansible prototype</a> that would manipulate
GitLab settings. When I first discovered Ansible, I was frustrated by
the YAML/Jinja DSL: it felt silly to write all this code in YAML when
you are a Python developer. It was great to see reasonably
well-written Python code that would do things and delegate the
metadata storage (and only that!) to YAML, as opposed to using YAML as
a DSL.</p>

<p>So I figured I would look at the Ansible documentation on how this
works, but unfortunately, the Ansible documentation is severly lacking
in this area. There are broken links (I only fixed <em>one</em> page) and
missing pieces. For example, the <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_plugins.html">developing plugins page</a> doesn't
explain how to program a plugin at all.</p>

<p>I was told on IRC that: "<em>documentation around developing plugins is
sparse in general. the code is the best documentation that exists
(right now)</em>". I didn't get a reply when asking <em>which</em> code in
particular could provide good examples either. In comparison, Puppet
has excellent documentation on how to create <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/5.1/custom_types.html">custom types</a>,
<a href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/5.1/functions_ruby_overview.html">functions</a> and <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/facter/3.8/fact_overview.html">facts</a>. That is definitely a turn-off for a new
contributor, but at least my pull request was merged in and I can only
hope that seasoned Ansible contributors expand on this critical piece
of documentation eventually.</p>

<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>

<p>As you can see, I'm all over the place, as usual. GitHub tells me I
"Opened 13 <em>other</em> pull requests in 11 repositories" (emphasis mine),
which I guess means on top of the "9 commits in 5 repositories"
mentioned earlier. My <a href="https://github.com/anarcat">profile</a> probably tells a more detailed
story that what would be useful to mention here. I should also mention
how difficult it is to write those reports: I basically do a
combination of looking into my GitHub and GitLab profiles, the last 30
days of emails <img alt="(!)" src="http://anarc.at/smileys/idea.png" /> and filesystem changes (!!). En vrac, a list of
changes which may be of interest:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/scripts/blob/master/font-large">font-large</a> (and its alias, <a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/scripts/blob/master/font-small">font-small</a>): shortcut to send
the right escape sequence to rxvt so it changes its font</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/scripts/blob/master/fix-acer">fix-acer</a>: short script to hardcode the modeline (you remember
those?!) for my screen which has a broken EDID pin (so
autodetection fails, yay Xorg log files...)</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/scripts/blob/master/ikiwiki-pandoc-quickie">ikiwiki-pandoc-quickie</a>: fake ikiwiki renderer that (ab)uses
pandoc to generate a HTML file with the right stylesheet to preview
Markdown as it <em>may</em> look in this blog (the basic template is
missing still)</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/scripts/blob/master/git-annex-transfer">git-annex-transfer</a>: a command I've often been missing in
<a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/">git-annex</a>, which is a way to transfer files between remotes
without having to copy them locally (<a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/transitive_transfers/">upstream feature request</a>)</li>
<li>I linked the graphics of the Debian archive software architecture
in the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDak">Debian wiki</a> in the hope more people notice it.</li>
<li>I did some tweaks on my <a href="https://github.com/travitch/taffybar/">Taffybar</a> to introduce a battery meter
and hoping to have temperature sensors, which mostly
failed. there's a pending <a href="https://github.com/travitch/taffybar/pull/157">pull request</a> that may bring some
sense into this, hopefully.</li>
<li>I made two <a href="https://0xacab.org/monkeysphere/monkeysign/commit/2d5df2b499c1d2da7fd1d509fc7784e4d67093d9">small</a> <a href="https://0xacab.org/monkeysphere/monkeysign/commit/c296bf82e7de224281844e2b07d5b803ce501619">patches</a> in <a href="https://0xacab.org/monkeysphere/monkeysign/">Monkeysign</a> to fix
gpg.conf handling and multiple email output, a dumb bug I cannot
believe anyone noticed or reported just yet. Thanks Valerie for the
bug report! The upload of this in Debian is pending a review from
the <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/871937">release team</a>.</li>

# Debian Long Term Support (LTS)

This is my monthly [Debian LTS][1] report. This month I worked on a few major
packages that took a long time instead of multiple smaller issues. Affected
packages were Mercurial, libdbd-mysql-perl and Ruby.

   [1]: <https://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html>

## Mercurial updates

Mercurial was vulnerable to two CVEs: [CVE-2017-1000116][2] (command injection on clients through malicious ssh URLs) and [CVE-2017-1000115][3] (path traversal via symlink). The former is an issue that actually affects many other similar software like Git ([CVE-2017-1000117][4]), Subversion ([CVE-2017-9800][5]) and even CVS ([CVE-2017-12836][6]). The latter symlink issue is a distinct issue that came up during an internal audit.

   [2]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-1000116>
   [3]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-1000115>
   [4]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-1000117>
   [5]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-9800>
   [6]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-12836>

The fix, shipped as [DLA-1072-1][7], involved a rather difficult backport,
especially because the Mercurial test suite takes a long time to complete.
This reminded me of the virtues of `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=4`, which sped
up the builds considerably. I also discovered that the Wheezy build chain
doesn't support [sbuild][8]'s `--source-only-changes` flag which I had
hardcoded in my [sbuild.conf][9] file. This seems to be simply because sbuild
passes `--build=source` to [dpkg-buildpackage][10], an option that is
supported only in jessie or later.

   [7]: <https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2017/08/msg00032.html>
   [8]: <http://manpages.debian.org/sbuild>
   [9]: <http://manpages.debian.org/sbuild%2Econf>
   [10]: <http://manpages.debian.org/dpkg%2Dbuildpackage>

## libdbd-mysql-perl

I have worked on fixing two issues with the [libdbd-mysql-perl][11] package,
[CVE-2017-10788][12] and [CVE-2017-10789][13], which resulted in the
[DLA-1079-1][14] upload. Behind this mysteriously named package sits a
critical piece of infrastructure, namely the `mysql` commandline client which
is probably used and abused by hundreds if not thousands of home-made scripts,
but also all of Perl's MySQL support, which is probably used by even a larger
base of software.

   [11]: <http://packages.debian.org/libdbd%2Dmysql%2Dperl>
   [12]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-10788>
   [13]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-10789>
   [14]: <https://lists.debian.org/20170831115827.eaciz7h6g7ecl5jh@curie.anarc.at>

Through the Debian bug reports ([Debian bug #866818][15] and [Debian bug
#866821][16]), I have learned that the patches existed in the upstream tracker
but were either [ignored][17] or even [reverted][18] in the latest 4.043
upstream release. It turns out that there are talks of [forking that
library][19] because of maintainership issue. It blows my mind that such an
important part of MySQL is basically unmaintained.

   [15]: <http://bugs.debian.org/866818>
   [16]: <http://bugs.debian.org/866821>
   [17]: <https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-mysql/issues/120#issuecomment-325342844>
   [18]: <https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-mysql/issues/110>
   [19]: <https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.dbi.dev/2017/08/msg8030.html>

I ended up backporting the upstream patches, which was also somewhat difficult
because of the long-standing issues with SSL support in MySQL. The backport
there was particularly hard to test, as you need to run that test suite by
hand, twice: once with a server configured with a (valid!) SSL certificate and
one without (!). I'm wondering how much time it is really worth spending on
trying to fix SSL in MySQL, however. It has been badly broken forever, and
while the patch _is_ an improvement, I would actually still never trust SSL
transports in MySQL over an untrusted network. The few people that I know use
such transports wrap their connections around a simpler [stunnel][20] instead.

   [20]: <http://packages.debian.org/stunnel>

The other issue was easier to fix so I submitted a [pull request upstream][21]
to make sure that work isn't lost, although it is not clear what the future of
that patch (or project!) will be at this point.

   [21]: <https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-mysql/pull/142>

## Rubygems

I also worked on the [rubygems][22] issues, which, thanks to the "vendoring"
practice of the Ruby community, also affects the [ruby1.9][23] package. 4
distinct CVEs were triaged here ([CVE-2017-0899][24], [CVE-2017-0900][25],
[CVE-2017-0901][26] and [CVE-2017-0902][27]) and I determined the latter issue
didn't affect wheezy as rubygems doesn't do its own DNS resolution there
(later versions lookup SRV records).

   [22]: <http://packages.debian.org/rubygems>
   [23]: <http://packages.debian.org/ruby1%2E9>
   [24]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-0899>
   [25]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-0900>
   [26]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-0901>
   [27]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/CVE-2017-0902>

This is another package where the test suite takes a long time to run. Worse,
the packages in Wheezy actually fails to build from source: the test suites
just fail in various steps, particularly because of `dh key too small` errors
for Rubygems, but also other errors for Ruby. I also had trouble backporting
one test which I had to simply skip for Rubygems. I uploaded and
[announced][28] test packages and hopefully I'll be able to complete this work
soon, although I would certainly appreciate any help on this...

   [28]: <https://lists.debian.org/87h8wkzyos.fsf@curie.anarc.at>

## Triage

I took a look at the [sox][29], [libvorbis][30] and [exiv2][31] issues. None
had fixes available. sox and exiv2 were basically a list of fuzzing issues,
which are often minor or at least of unknown severity. Those would have
required a significant amount of work and I figured I would prioritize other
work first.

   [29]: <http://packages.debian.org/sox>
   [30]: <http://packages.debian.org/libvorbis>
   [31]: <http://packages.debian.org/exiv2>

I also triaged [CVE-2017-7506][32], which doesn't seem to affect the
[spice][33] package in wheezy, after doing a fairly thorough audit of the
code. The vulnerability is specifically bound to the
`reds_on_main_agent_monitors_config` function, which is simply not present in
our older version. A hostile message would fall through the code and not
provoke memory allocation or out of bounds access, so I simply marked the
wheezy version as `not-affected`, something which usually happens during the
original triage but can also happen during the actual patching work, as in
this case.

# Other free software work

This describes the volunteer work I do on various free software projects. This
month, again, my internal reports show that I spent about the same time on
volunteer and paid time, but this is probably a wrong estimate because I spent
a lot of time at Debconf which I didn't clock in...

## Debconf

So I participated in the [17th Debian Conference][34] in Montreal. It was
great to see (and make!) so many friends from all over the world in person
again, and I was happy to work on specific issues together with other Debian
developers. I am especially thankful to David Bremner for fixing the syncing
of the `flagged` tag when added to new messages ([patch series][35]). This
allows me to easily sync the one tag (`inbox`) that is not statically assigned
during `notmuch new`, by using `flagged` as a synchronization tool. This
allows me to use notmuch more easily across multiple machines without having
to sync all tags with dump/restore or using muchsync which wasn't working for
me (although a [new release came out][36] which may fix my issues). The magic
incantation looks something like this:

    
       [34]: <http://debconf17.debconf.org/>
   [35]: <https://notmuchmail.org/pipermail/notmuch/2017/025046.html>
   [36]: <https://notmuchmail.org/pipermail/notmuch/2017/024500.html>

    notmuch tag -inbox tag:inbox and not tag:flagged
    notmuch tag +inbox not tag:inbox and tag:flagged
    

However, most of my time in the first week (Debcamp) was spent trying to
complete the networking setup: configure switches, setup wiring and so on. I
also configured an [apt-cacher-ng][37] proxy to serve packages to attendees
during the conference. I configured it with Avahi to configure clients
automatically, which led me to discover (and fix) issue [Debian bug
#870321][38]) although there are more issues with the autodiscovery
mechanism... I spent extra time to document the (somewhat simple)
configuration of such a server in the [Debian wiki][39] because it was not the
first time I had research that procedure...

I somehow thought this was a great time to upgrade my laptop to stretch.
Normally, I keep that device running stable because I don't use it often and I
don't want to have major traumatizing upgrades every time I leave with it on a
trip. But this time was special: there were literally _hundreds_ of Debian
developers to help me out if there was trouble. And there was, of course,
trouble as it turns out! I had problems with the fonts on my display, because,
well, I had _suspended_ (twice) my laptop _during_ the install. The fix was
simply to flush the fontconfig cache, and I tried to document this in the
[fonts wiki page][40] and my [upgrades page][41].

I also gave a short training called [Debian packaging 101][42] which was
pretty successful. Like the short presentation I made at the last [Montreal
BSP][43], the workshop was based on my [quick debian development guide][44].
I'm thinking of expanding this to a larger audience with a "102" course that
would discuss more complex packaging problems. But my secret plan (well,
secret until now I guess) is to make packaging procedures more uniform in
Debian by training new Debian packagers using that same training for the next
2 decades. But I will probably start by just trying to do this again at the
next Debconf, if I can attend.

## Debian uploads

I also sponsored two packages during Debconf: one was a "scratch an itch"
upload ([elpa-ivy][45]) which I requested ([Debian bug #863216][46]) as part
of a larger effort to ship the Emacs elisp packages as Debian packages. The
other was an [upload][47] of [diceware][48] to build the documentation in a
separate package and fix other issues I have found in the package during a
review.

   [47]: <https://tracker.debian.org/news/864378>
   [48]: <http://packages.debian.org/diceware>

I also uploaded a bunch of other fixes to the Debian archive:

  * [slop][49] upstream update and matching [maim][50] NMU
  * asked for [gnome-web-photo][51] removal ([Debian bug #873015][52])
  * [charybdis][53] 3.5.5-2 to officially switch to [mbedtls][54] ([Debian bug #705369][55])
  * [gmpc][56]: ship pending patches from git and Ubuntu
  * [horst][57]: new upstream release and workaround for sparse bug [Debian bug #873508][58]
  * uploaded [percol][59] to NEW ([Debian bug #754972][60])

   [60]: <http://bugs.debian.org/754972>

## Signing keys rotation

I also started the process of moving my main OpenPGP certification key by
adding a signing subkey. The subkey is stored in a cryptographic token so I
can sign things on more than one machine without storing that critical key on
all those devices physically.

Unfortunately, this meant that I need to do some shenanigans when I want to
sign content in my Debian work, because the new subkey takes time to propagate
to the Debian archive. For example, I have to specify the primary key with a
"bang" when signing packages (`debsign -k '792152527B75921E!' ...`) or use
inline signatures in email sent for security announcement (since that trick
doesn't work in Mutt _or_ Notmuch). I tried to figure out how to better
coordinate this next time by reading up documentation on
[keyring.debian.org][61], but there is no fixed date for key changes on the
rsync interface. There are "monthly changes" so one's best bet is to look for
the last change in their git repository.

   [61]: <https://keyring.debian.org/>

## GitLab.com and LFS migration

I finally turned off my [src.anarc.at][62] git repository service by moving
the remaining repos to [GitLab][63]. Unfortunately, GitLab [removed support
for git-annex][64] recently, so I had to migrate my repositories to Git-LFS,
which was an interesting experience. LFS is pretty easy to use, definitely
simpler than git-annex. It also seems to be a good match for the use-case at
hand, which is to store large files (videos, namely) as part of slides for
presentations.

   [62]: <http://src.anarc.at/>
   [63]: <https://gitlab.com/>
   [64]: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1648>

It turns out that their migration guide could have been made much simpler. I
tried to submit those changes to the documentation but [couldn't fork the
GitLab EE project][65] to make a patch, so I just documented the issue in [the
original MR][66] for now. While I was there I filed a [feature request][67] to
add a new reference shortcut (`GL-NNN`) after noticing a similar token [used
on GitHub][68]. This would be a useful addition because I often have numbering
conflicts between Debian BTS bug numbers and GitLab issues in packages I
maintain there. In particular, I have problems using GitLab issue numbers in
Monkeysign, because commit logs end up in Debian changelogs and will be
detected by the Debian infrastructure even though those are GitLab bug
numbers. Using such a shortcut would avoid detection and such a conflict.

## Numpy-stats

I wrote a small tool to extract numeric statistics from a given file. I often
do ad-hoc benchmarks where I store a bunch of numbers in a file and then try
to make averages and so on. As an exercise in learning [NumPy][69], I figured
I would write such a simple tool, called [numpy-stats][70], which probably
sounds naive to seasoned Python scientists.

   [69]: <http://www.numpy.org/>
   [70]: <https://gitlab.com/anarcat/scripts/blob/master/numpy-stats>

My incentive was that I was trying to figure out what was the distribution of
password length in a given [password generator scheme][71]. So I wrote this
simple script:

    
       [71]: <https://superuser.com/questions/237228/command-line-tool-to-generate-memorable-passwords/1246245#comment1828733_1052689>

    for i in seq 10000 ; do
        shuf -n4 /usr/share/dict/words | tr -d '\n'
    done > length
    

And then feed that data in the tool:

    
    
    $ numpy-stats lengths 
    {
      "max": 60, 
      "mean": 33.883293722913464, 
      "median": 34.0, 
      "min": 14, 
      "size": 143060, 
      "std": 5.101490225062775
    }
    

I am surprised that there isn't such a tool already: hopefully I am wrong and
will just be pointed towards the better alternative in the comments here!

## Safe Eyes

I added [screensaver support][72] to the new [SafeEyes][73] project, which I
am considering as a replacement to the [workrave][74] project I have been
using for years. I really like how the interruptions basically block the whole
screen: way more effective than only blocking the keyboard, because all
potential distractions go away.

   [72]: <https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes/commit/6a8b29a87baa53aca2ccc3e280079d04c2b2bf39>
   [73]: <https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes/>
   [74]: <http://packages.debian.org/workrave>

One feature that is missing is [keystrokes and mouse movement counting][75]
and of course an [official Debian package][76], although the latter would be
easy to fix because upstream already has an unofficial build. I am thinking of
writing my own little tool to count keystrokes, since the overlap between
SafeEyes and such a counter isn't absolutely necessary. This is something that
workrave does, but there are "idle time" extensions in Xorg that do not _need_
to count keystrokes. There are already certain tools to count input events,
but none seem to do what I want (most of them are basically keyloggers). It
would be an interesting test to see if it's possible to write something that
would work both for Xorg and Wayland at the same time. Unfortunately,
preliminary research show that:

   [75]: <https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes/issues/184>
   [76]: <https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes/issues/183>

  1. in Xorg, the only way to implement this is to sniff all events, ie. to implement a keylogger

  2. in Wayland, this is [completely unsupported][77]. it seems _some_ compositors _could_ implement such a counter, but then it means that this is compositor specific, or, in other words, unportable

   [77]: <https://superuser.com/questions/1032270/wayland-alternative-for-xorgs-xdotool>

So there is little hope here, which brings to my mind "painmeter" as an
appropriate name for this future programming nightmare.

## Ansible

I sent my first contribution to the [ansible][78] project with a small
[documentation fix][79]. I had an eye opener recently when I discovered a
[GitLab ansible prototype][80] that would manipulate GitLab settings. When I
first discovered Ansible, I was frustrated by the YAML/Jinja DSL: it felt
silly to write all this code in YAML when you are a Python developer. It was
great to see reasonably well-written Python code that would do things and
delegate the metadata storage (and only that!) to YAML, as opposed to using
YAML as a DSL.

   [78]: <http://packages.debian.org/ansible>
   [79]: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/28766>
   [80]: <https://gist.github.com/kpcyrd/1bde93b2bb9c77e0b6c14a2b3f75b026>

So I figured I would look at the Ansible documentation on how this works, but
unfortunately, the Ansible documentation is severly lacking in this area.
There are broken links (I only fixed _one_ page) and missing pieces. For
example, the [developing plugins page][81] doesn't explain how to program a
plugin at all.

   [81]: <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_plugins.html>

I was told on IRC that: " _documentation around developing plugins is sparse
in general. the code is the best documentation that exists (right now)_ ". I
didn't get a reply when asking _which_ code in particular could provide good
examples either. In comparison, Puppet has excellent documentation on how to
create [custom types][82], [functions][83] and [facts][84]. That is definitely
a turn-off for a new contributor, but at least my pull request was merged in
and I can only hope that seasoned Ansible contributors expand on this critical
piece of documentation eventually.

   [82]: <https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/5.1/custom_types.html>
   [83]: <https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/5.1/functions_ruby_overview.html>
   [84]: <https://docs.puppet.com/facter/3.8/fact_overview.html>

## Misc

As you can see, I'm all over the place, as usual. GitHub tells me I "Opened 13
_other_ pull requests in 11 repositories" (emphasis mine), which I guess means
on top of the "9 commits in 5 repositories" mentioned earlier. My
[profile][85] probably tells a more detailed story that what would be useful
to mention here. I should also mention how difficult it is to write those
reports: I basically do a combination of looking into my GitHub and GitLab
profiles, the last 30 days of emails \(!\) and filesystem changes (!!). En
vrac, a list of changes which may be of interest:

   [85]: <https://github.com/anarcat>

  * [font-large][86] (and its alias, [font-small][87]): shortcut to send the right escape sequence to rxvt so it changes its font
  * [fix-acer][88]: short script to hardcode the modeline (you remember those?!) for my screen which has a broken EDID pin (so autodetection fails, yay Xorg log files...)
  * [ikiwiki-pandoc-quickie][89]: fake ikiwiki renderer that (ab)uses pandoc to generate a HTML file with the right stylesheet to preview Markdown as it _may_ look in this blog (the basic template is missing still)
  * [git-annex-transfer][90]: a command I've often been missing in [git-annex][91], which is a way to transfer files between remotes without having to copy them locally ([upstream feature request][92])
  * I linked the graphics of the Debian archive software architecture in the [Debian wiki][93] in the hope more people notice it.
  * I did some tweaks on my [Taffybar][94] to introduce a battery meter and hoping to have temperature sensors, which mostly failed. there's a pending [pull request][95] that may bring some sense into this, hopefully.
  * I made two [small][96] [patches][97] in [Monkeysign][98] to fix gpg.conf handling and multiple email output, a dumb bug I cannot believe anyone noticed or reported just yet. Thanks Valerie for the bug report! The upload of this in Debian is pending a review from the [release team][99].
